I went there for a we lunch during new year's week end. Service is excellent with always a smile. The food is delicious, especially the fish and chips which awesom

To be honest, is a review really necessary? Great food, great service, great atmosphere, anything you would expect from Chef Gordon Ramsay. Dare I say a perfect place for a casual dinner for families. If you are looking for places with nice food in MBS and you are into western food, look no further. This place exceeds what my expectations for it and I have no words to describe it anymore

I visited this restaurant whilst staying at Marina Bay Sands and I have nothing but good things to say. The food was amazing as was the service. Because it was my birthday I was even given a lovely little cake and the waiters sang happy birthday. When you are given your bill at the end of the meal they bring out a little jar of cookies for your table to share. Little touches like this set this restaurant apart from the many other options to choose from in this area.

We dropped in for lunch before flying home, we hadn’t booked but got the last table, exceptional... service was A1 and very friendly, food , I had tamarind chicken wings for starter, the wife had a king crab cocktail, both of us had fish and chips, all truly scrumptious.. Mr Ramsay you should be very proud of your food and your staff... we will be bac

Service: 10/10 Food: 9/10 I was early for my table and was placed at the bar to check out the menu. They served us bread which tasted fantastic. The sour dough, multi grain and bread stick stand out among the rest and the butter is great compliment to the bread. FYI they do sell the bread to take away at quite affordable price, good for breakfast the next day. We ordered english breakfast, pork belly and black cod. The skin of the pork belly were crispy (love that part). The sauce on the black cod compliments the fish perfectly but would recommend to dip with other stuff if you would want to finish the sauce as it's abit salty. We ordered scramble eggs on the english breakfast which was good, the baked beans which comes with it tasted like no ordinary baked beans. They used tomato as the sauce on the baked beans. Overall the experience was great, price wise is affordable.

An extensive menu for wine and cocktails, definitely recommended for someone who enjoys drinking. Food menu was rather average, nothing to shout out for. Pre-ordered the beef Wellington for $80 (1 pax portion), which was worth ordering but other then that, don’t think I’m heading back for its normal menu items

The atmosphere gives you the feel you are dinning on a street side with the hustle and bustle .our table was on the upper level so we had a view of the sidewalk .food was great service good a well stocked ba

How do you find such upbeat staff?? We had lunch at BSK in Singapore twice while we were there and would go back in a heartbeat. Everyone was friendly and jovial plus the service as well as the food was excellent! We had the Scallops(both times) the sauce was the key with this! The salmon tartar was very creative and was not at all what I expected and I was pleasantly surprised. The mushroom tart tasted like more both times! The restaurant itself is a comfortable environment that you don’t want to leave. To everyone there, well done!

Came for brunch. Had a salad with prawns and gammon steak. Food was served promptly and staff was attentive and friendly. Host was accomodating to find a suitable table for pregnant wife. The gluten free menu had lots of options to choose from. Good place for brunch
5
Our experience at BSK was nothing short of amazing. The food was to die for. Selection on the menu for appetizers, entrees, desert and all else was awesome. The staff were very attentive and respectfully friendly. Overall, highly impressed. Recommend this place to anyone who loves exquisitely prepared, delicious food
5
Not knowing where we were lunching the wife and I were excited for a new adventure. When we arrived the queue was very long but friends had booked well in advance.From the UK the Wife had eaten and GR other establishments and was very excited to dine.I can say you will not be disappointed food is excellent the craft beers and wine a well chosen and the decor very Ramsey.For those who want to "scoff and off" you can't do it here service is well timed and for those impatient amongst you this is not for you. However if you enjoy a good experience then my advice is to book this up well in advance, take some good friends, relax and enjoy.I recommend the scotch eggs, mushroom risotto and Mr Ramsay version of a snickers bar. Omg. AMAZING

Not to be emotional, just list of facts:We booked table 21:30 on line on a way from Night zoo safari and did show up right on time, got menu to read for 10 min standing next to the door while team slowly were preparing table for us... 30 min latter, first drink, bottle of chardonnay came room temperature... it took 10 min in addition to chill in ice before we could taste it... guy serving us was obviously not interested in us at all... bet he was tired, but possible just attitude too... should admit food was good, as expected... was it jus end of the day?... could be, but was extremely disappointing and the worst restaurant we experienced trough whole week in Singapore...

I chosen this resto to celebrate my birthday and I am glad to say that I did not regret the experience here. They gave me complimentary cake and sang me happy birthday. Place is relaxing and food are good and most of it can be shared. Will try other menu soon

Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay we were really looking forward to eating in one of his restaurants, however found this place to be dull, no atmosphere, service was poor and the food was just ok. Far better places to eat for half the price

I went to this restaurant hoping for a fun dinner at a Celebrity Restaurant, and for what I thought would be a very nice restaurant. Simply speaking, the steak was mediocre. It was well prepared, but not much else. Maybe I am just this way, but when I spend that much on a steak, I expect it to be excellent. Full disclosure, I may also be biased, as the night prior to Bread Street Kitchen, I ate at CUT, also in the Marina Bay Sands, and was blown away by the steak. Possibly one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.To sum it up, if you want a burger or something, perhaps this place will work. The gentleman next to me had a burger that looked very good, and if I ever go back, I will try that. But, if you wanted something better than an average steak, go elsewhere
4
We’re fans of Gordon Ramsay... die die also must come here once. Very good first impression... however disappointing meal - the sliders were too tough! Staff ‘rectified’ the situation by serving us a brownie cake which was sooooo good! Will try to be back again..
5
Not as expensive as we thought it might be. Was convenient after watching the light show in Marina Bay. We hadn't reserved a table but as it was a Tuesday evening so we were lucky. The staff were friendly but seemed to want to rush things but we resisted being rushed and had an enjoyable evening. Would highly recommend
4
We ordered the burger, lamb chops, ceasar salad and the beef wellington. The beef wellington supposed to be ordered before hand but we were lucky that it was available. May be because the beef wellington was so boasted that we have high expectation and when we tried, we found that it was just ok. My husband and son even said that the lamb chop is the best among others
5
Gordon is Gordon and his restaurant is a representation of his spirit. Contemporary, great food, excellent service. If you expect big portions go somewhere else. The scallops with bacon and red pepper are unique.
5
We gather here for a dinner and is best you make a reservation first. Though it may be pricy but you are paying for quality. It's such a comfort n relaxing place as you can watch the crowds passing by too. So far most of the dish we order were very good. I love the desserts, if you are a lover of desserts, you will just love it. Tefer to the photos of the menus we order
3
Manage too get a table outside. It was a cool evening so no problems. After 10 min we were give some water. The service was mediocre but food acceptable
1
I had a 7pm reservation and found the restaurant in what could be called a food court. Was seated at the bar, and quickly and pleasantly greeted. The name sake bread was simply average. A bread stick, oat coated bun, and slice of rosemary herbed bread, all resembled each other flavour wise. The bartender concocted a pineapple rum drink, that simply missed on flavor. The order of onion soup, quinoa salad, and Tamarid wings were hawker center quality. Hence the food court location. Save your money and move along..
2
Disappointing for a Ramsay restaurant - four of us dined for brunch and one of us was happy with our meal. Not quite the standard one would expect for this venue. Gorgeous casual restaurant with two levels - downstairs had a casual industrial feel with an open kitchen which was lovely - staff average service and we wouldn't go back unfortunately
3
The BSK concept is very simple: well-executed familiar dishes prepared with good-quality ingredients, then use the brand name to charge (super) premium pricing. Service is friendly and competent by a well-trained staff. The wine list has some good selections. Nothing to complain about if prices are not an issue (like if you’re loaded or when you come as someone’s guest); otherwise, I would prefer to go to a place with more innovative dishes, even if I had to pay a bit more. Ironically, the bread is definitely not memorable! ;
5
Stumbling upon BSK wandering through Marina Bay we were delighted to secure a table. With few expectations we loved our two meals. Thrilled to get a table one evening we enjoyed it so much we came back the next day for lunch. Our main enjoyment came from the wonderful mushroom risotto, short rib beef burger and amazing pork belly. Considering the reasonable price we were very impressed
5
We celebrate New Year 2018 at this restaurant. Booked table for six person at the middle of December. All was great. One of the best cousin I’ve ever tried. Staff was more then friendly - it was like we was one family and celebrate together.And yes, this place is very popular at the evening, so if you want to be sure to get in - make your reservation prior.I’m strongly recommend this place for all who trying to find good steak and very good cocktails for very sparing prices. As bonus, you will have one of the best view for evening show at Singapore Marina. (Note that now there is some kind of repair works in front of the restaurant)Cheers to all staff and thanks a lot for our amazing diner

We were here as guests of a local family. I don't like being negative but I was really disappointed . The starters were average and we ordered four different mains passable but not exciting. Dessert was very ordinary . The service was a bit haphazard with two waiters bring food and drinks we had not ordered. Mr .Ramsay you need to come visit your Bread Street Kitchen stay a while and bring it up to expectations
5
We did not pre book but this was not an issue as they were really good in getting us a table when the restaurant was really busy. We had a table outside which offered amazing views. Staff were really attentive and friendly. The food was amazing I had the fish and chips which was lovely. Would recommend the restaurant as a great place to eat
5
Gordon is one of my mentors, so this needed to be good, and thankfully is was. We had the festive sea bass and the sirloin. Food wise everything was near perfect, even the chunky chips were almost perfect. The service was good, but very slow. The atmosphere was good, but VERY noisy as the restaurant has no separation / acoustic dampers. We were okay until 3 very load Australians sat next to shouting and swearing for an hour. To be fair we experienced many loud restaurants and many Asians do shout when they speak. Hope our visit to Gordon Ramsey in April 2018 will be better on the service & ambience side

Son decided that we have to have late lunch here!! Had burger and gammon with egg and a kids pasta!! Overall pretty good meal!! Had their snicker’s bar for dessert!! Is a child friendly venue!! Reservation recommended for weekend!! This is my 4 or 5 visits !! Worth the while !!
5
This restaurant really meets our expectations, I came along with 5 people and all our dishes were very tasty. I really recommend
4
This was my 4th visit to bread street kitchen, and the 3rd for dinner. The food was predictably good. I had the seared scallops with a creamy cauliflower sauce for a starter; one of my party had the king crab with apples which he pronounced as excellent. For mains I had the baked black cod - also excellent, and done just right. Two of the others who had the beef and lamb chops also were very happy.Surprisingly, the service was good. I think it even improved - which is such a rarity these days. Would recommend if one is visiting Singapore and wants to try one of the so-called "celebrity restaurants"

With all respect to Gordon Ramsay, our favourite TV chef star, Bread Street Kitchen has failed us twice in our three visits over the past two years.During my most recent visit, I ordered a Thanksgiving Set which included a starter plate of cheesy mushroom plus deep-fried chicken drumsticks crumbed with sweeten peanut, and a huge roasted black colour turkey drumstick as the main course. The mushrooms were too sweet as it was served with jam. Quite unfortunate that the chicken were equally too sweet. The turkey was super salty and I needed to 'steal' the chips from my guest who had ordered a Fish & Chips with the fish under-cooked (raw to be exact) and hard to cut.In summary, the kitchen served us sugar, salt and rock for lunch during this visit. Together with a Americano coffee, the bill was S$122.41

Had a disappointing Christmas Lunch at The Bread Kitchen on Christmas afternoon 2017. Once seated we asked if there were any tables upstairs as we had booked a month earlier but were told no meals were being served up there.Out of 6 meals 2 were served with pink turkey and one served cold so obviously they were sent back but which then meant we all ate at separate times as they did not all get served back together.All our party felt their meals were pretty mediocre and therefore we were all disappointed.None of the staff apologised for this......eventually we were given crackers after several requests.We then went upstairs to enjoy a drink in the sunshine only to discover all tables being waited on.The manager listened to our concerns but only shrugged . His attitude was the most frustrating thing.Friends were going for New Year....they cancelle

We were walking past, saw the packed dining room and walked in. Luckily for us, we were after a late lunch, and secured a spot for an hour later. After a leisurely stroll among the luxury Marina Bay Shoppes we returned and were shown to a spot by the window.In short order, we were served with a complimentary bread basket and butter. The hungry teen made short order of the basket of a warm roll, 2 slices of different breads, 2 bread sticks and a crispy slice of seed-studded flat bread. I had a bite of each and they were all delicious.We opted for the set lunch which was fantastic value at S$40++ for 2 courses and S$48++ for 3 courses (++ in Singapore denotes +10% for service in lieu of tips, and +7% GST, adding about 18% to the original menu prices). We chose 2 courses rather than 3 as I don’t have the tummy space for 3 courses, and none of the entrees appealed to hungry teen. Instead, he had a stracciatella milkshake (vanilla ice cream with chocolate bits, pistachio liqueur and topped with mini marshmallows).Teen had Steak and Ale hot pot served with fried spätzle on the side and I had pan fried sea bass on zucchini noodles with fennel sauce on the side. The steak and ale hot pot was excellent with tender meat bathed in a voluptuous sauce. It was so good that hungry teen ate the mushrooms (routinely fished out and discarded) and was scraping the pot for the last lick of sauce. The sea bass was fresh and moist with a super crispy skin. The zucchini noodles it rested on were okay, nothing great. However the accompanying fennel sauce was very moreish. Desserts: the brownie with ice cream was good, but not the best. The British cheese board was very nice with three slices of soft to semi-hard cheeses, 3 warm oat(?) biscuits and sweet fruit chutney. Though replete after my main, I cleaned the board! I do like my cheeses!Um...about the service ... As it’s semi-casual, I don’t expect high end silver service standards. However, I didn’t expect the plonk-and-go service that we experienced either. Given we had our meals after the peak lunch crowd and the restaurant was more than half empty, a few words about the food being placed in front of us wouldn’t have gone amiss.Verdict: go for British fare done well, but don’t expect service to match
4
The ambience is nice and romantic, with dimly lit candles; the view of the Marina Bay area is great; the food is good; we ordered angus beef; the portion is quite huge, and it is quite a fill together with the side dishes. There is a generous free flow of different kinds of bread. We are also given some cookies at the end of the meal
5
I was very delighted traditional food twisted with very unique and delight flavor.Fish & chip fish was big and well crusted, while soft inside with no oily smell of fish.Mac & cheese had different layer of cheese with smaller cut macaroni, with great crumbles. BBQ wing for kids had great deep fried crust with well seasoned sauce. My only disappointment was with dry aged steak. Out layer of steak was rather hard, especially fat part of steak was little bit burnt. Maybe it’s just not my type. Overall great experience, will surely come back for other menus to try
3
It’s a great setting and the service was great, but the food was completely average. The salmon tartare was nice, and the soup was tasty enough. I was happy when our main course arrived, it looked great. But the steak, chips and onion rings were tasteless. Not sure if it was the produce or whether they just needed to be seasoned properly. The batter on the onion rings was thick so that probably didn’t help with the blandness. The Brussel sprouts were not only bland but also undercooked. Won’t be rushing back anytime soon.
2
Food was average for a celebrity chef. Seems to be a common theme with all celeb restaurants. Over priced and underwhelming.

Singapore has slowly been gaining a reputation as a center of food innovation. And, being in the industry I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Singapore's best­kept secrets both local street food and gourmet for many years now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so­called food revolution happening in the Marina Bay Area has seen many of the city's best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this lovely Bay Area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Bread Street Kitchen.Nestled amid the Shoppes that pepper the Marina Bay Sands trendy Shopping district, BSK is the brainchild of Chef Gordon Ramsay.The restaurant is located in the Mall and is a double stormy space which is modeled on the UK restaurant that’s quite easy to miss. However, the interior is cozy and warm with lovely lighting, decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn’t the only thing bringing folks to BSK. Under Jenna Sendall's leadership the restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.We started with BSK's famous foie gras pate with buttery soft brioche which is served with a lovely pickle spicy and was truly remarkable, indeed he other appetizer was perfectly chilled spicy salmon tartare with crispy wanton skins served. My wife and I shared one order, of avocado and watermelon salad and the kids dived into delicious roasted scallops which consisted of six scallops served on the half shell.We certainly could have shared a second order, though that is more a reflection on the otherworldly taste than the portion size.For the main course, I decided to go with the celebrated roasted black cod on a bed of creamy potato. The flavor of the cod was amazing and beautifully cooked and he potato balanced the richness of the sinfully tender fish and sauce very well. My wife and daughter ordered Aberdeen angus ribeye, which consisted of a per broiled grilled 12 oz , medium rare steak, and cherry tomatoes. My son ordered the Beef Wellington, the dish was executed perfectly, and the bright colors of the side order of Brussels sprouts, glazed carrots and mashed potato was the best accompaniment which made it a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. The servings were big and excellent value for money, well worth it!There were a few dessert six in all, all served on a platter including amazing mango cheesecake and chocolate molten cake and I went with an original Chef Sabrina Stillhart's cheese selection.Sabrina has spent almost a decade within the Gordon Ramsay Group and also gave us a tour of the kitchen with the manageress Jenna.My wife and kids loved the selections of dark chocolate molten cake and said the chocolate cake was simply divine.Overall an amazing experience not o be missed.

Gordon, you know I am right when I say it is about making the effort for the customer and I have to say the team excelled when I visited. You were on my list of places to eat in Singapore and for lunch it was perfect. Great location and the only thing that was going to let it down was the staff (I had faith in the food). So as I was shown to my table, I saw your book. As a ex-chef Royal Naval and collector of cookery books it was a must and I did not have this one. I asked to have a look and if I could purchase it? I was told that disappointingly there was none available for sale as they were waiting on a delivery. So I read through your book think about Amazon, when I was delight to have handed to me a copy which they had managed to find, signed by all the staff and chefs (plus a signed photo of you). I have to be honest I was more made up by what your team did and I thought it was a great touch.The food did not disappoint too and this was a highlight to my trip to Singapore. I would like say a massive thank you to the BSK Team in Singapore. The only thing that could have made it better would be to cook alongside you

Enjoyed the beef Wellington, a signature dish. Our party of 4 adults was welcomed warmly and the service was great throughout the dinner. Particularly appreciated the sommeliers suggestion. It’s a little pricey for the experience.
5
My Wife booked us here for Christmas Day. We saw the menu and they were doing a traditional Christmas Dinner. Turkey with all the trimmings. Only they weren't!! As you can see by my Marks out of 5,it was a minor blip. Beef replaced the Turkey. The food ,ambience and staff were all superb. Maybe you should let people know in advance about the missing Turkey thoug
3
I know that this is not a fine dining restaurant but I was surprised to see that the chips that were served, with my order of fish and chips , were frozen ones - no way traditionallyl British. The fish was reasonable but it was spoiled by the batter around it which was burnt in places and left an acrid taste. My husband had the apple and blackberry crumble for desert but complained that it was nearly all crumble with very little fruit. On the upside, the staff were very friendly and attentive. I don't think I will visit this restaurant again nor can I recommend it. There are so many other good places to eat in Singapore

Big fans of the Bread street brand having dined at the London branch countless times and four time in Dubai. I cannot believe this place carries the same name. Staying at the MBS we booked a table here hoping to have an experience on par with the locations already mentioned.Arrived to chaotic scenes and nobody really knowing what was going on and was sent upstairs. When we were finally seated it took 40 minutes for a drink to arrive. The waitress who served us was very polite but there was no substance to the service, no recommendations just simply given a menu then returned to take the order. As there was no mention of specials I asked if the beef wellington was available. A dish I have enjoyed many of times from the brand. The waitress said she would go and ask, 10 minutes later we still hadn't ordered and when I finally got her attention again the realisation on her face showed she had forgotten and not even asked yet. It turned out to be available but sadly it was not worth the wait nor were the side dishes which are normally on par with the taste sensation of the meat. I don't know what was going on with the mac and cheese with the weird green stuff on top which was supposed to be roasted garlic but it was bordering on disgusting - not the same as Dubai.The food and the whole dining experience was so different to other bread streets I felt I had to go outside and check we were in the correct place. To those who have had a poor dining experience here all I would say is don't let it put you off trying the other branches, you will not believe the share the name

Came here to celebrate a birthday. Was keen on location and this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. But there are a few not so fantastic reviews. Well, service was excellent and friendly. Food came quickly and was very good. We tried a range - Turkey to risotto. In general this did not disappoint. Would recommend. It is a bit on the pricey side.
5
Went for drinks with a friend on the weekend and had an amazing experience. We missed our theatre show ( which is my fault) at the mbs theatre.. so we decided to go for a drink at Bread Street Kitchen. This experience really made up for it.William was super professional, friendly and approachable.. the wine was good and the desert platter was delicious. Thank you for giving us an amazing experience! Highly recommended

Fantastic service. Great wine list. By the bottle or by the glass. Amazing service. One of our favorite Singapore restaurants

To explore another celebrity restaurant at the Shoppes Mall was one more gourmet journey, this time to Bread Street Kitchen owned by the famous British culinary artist, Gordon Ramsay, a 3-Michelin star chef. Made a reservation for 4, thankful we had one right away, voila, we had a good table right by the window. Our server, Carlo, welcomed us graciously once seated. Ordered food was a feast for our palates, had the most delicious thick-cut duck breast with pumpkin purée, roasted cèpe, crispy kale in red wine sauce, the best duck breast I tasted so far, compared to the duck breasts I had in France where we live, the rest also enjoyed their roasted cod with crushed potatoes, salted capers, artichoke with red and lemon sauce. For the finale, desserts were thesavory chocolate fondant and the delectable apple and raspberry crumble with vanilla custard sauce. Great service by Carlo, good atmosphere, open kitchen and definitely a very good restaurant to recommend for foodies/hearty eaters
5
Reason coming to Bread Street is because of its owner, one of the world most well known chef, Chef Gordon Ramsay. The atmosphere of the dining is really good and suits whatever dish you're having. The food is well prepared and I'm impressed with the staffs. They are well prepared and ready to be in your service any time.Would come again for sur

Awesome quality food, very fresh and very well prepared.The fish & chips and the pork belly are wonderful. The black cod was divine!Portion is rather big, so go in groups to share and get to taste more dishes.We were 2 adults and 1 kid, and got really filled, and very happy.The staff was helpful, friendly and wonderful. And they threw in a surprise dessert and birthday song for my kid. Nice touch!Danica was very charming and lovely.Setting is very cosy. Book early to avoid disappointment.Will be back again soon

Where to begin.. upon entering the restaurant we were instantly greeted with a warm smile by the hostess. We had made a reservation and were taken to our table right away. Our server wasn’t far behind, making us feel welcome and gathering our drink orders. We shared some delicious appetizers including the flatbread, salmon tartar, sea bass carpaccio and watermelon salad. Everything was platted beautifully, came out in perfect timing and left our taste buds wanting more. I shared the grilled meat platter with one of my friends and WOW what a dish! Great portion sizes, perfectly cooked meats and the flavors were dancing in my mouth. We ended up taking some home as we wanted to leave some room for dessert (I am a sucker for something sweet!) We may have gone all out with dessert as well since everything looked too good not to try. We opted for the chocolate fondant, crumbled pie and spiced parfait. AMAZING. All three were divine but if I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the chocolate fondant (what girl doesn’t love chocolate??). The service throughout our three courses was suburb. As soon as it looked like we were done with a course he was right there to clear the plates and offer another glass of Pinot noir. Would highly recommend this restaurant for a casual night out with friends. Will definitely be back :)

We tried to book on Sunday and initially they indicated limited tables available for the Monday night. On arriving the restaurant was busy. Dinner menu was good and much better than the lunch menu from when I had visited some time back. Very happy with the starters main and shared desert. Restaurant was very noisy and they also piped music that was a little louder than you would expect. Lighting was very dim but I guess to give you a better view of the city lights outside. Overall a good experience. Bill was a tad over 500 for four people with only four glasses of wine. But we were happy with prices on the menu that were reasonable for quality and taste.
5
Absolutely loving the breakfast here.Coffee comes in a proper china cup!We have the English Breakfast and buttermilk pancakes .... the best ones we've ever had!Service was great, location was great
4
Good place to have dinner and the staff was really friendly. It might be bit more expensive than other restaurants but not that expensive as you would expect. Had the roasted duck breast with the pumpkin puree which was great and my partner had the mashroom risotto which was amazing. I do recommend
3
I was so excited to eat at Breadstreet Singapore! So so excited...But I left deflated, almost like I needed to get out of their asap towards the end..The food was AMAZING! Can I just say - big heads up to the chef, we loved the Lamb Chops and the Black Cod..which in a perfect world, its really the food that you should come to enjoy....we ate every morsel and enjoyed it (173 SGD)The part that let us down was the service, we were seated at the far end of the restaurant behind a service stand(?) ..so the rest of the restaurant was in front of this stand (where the wait staff prepped napkins etc) and there was one row behind it where we sat...so we got to watch a 'maybe' new waiter being tapped on the shoulder from a Miss Boss waiter (who coughed a lot in our area) constantly, like he wasn't watching what was happening, it was so very awkward. Not sure what we did to be seated that far behind the scenes?Would I dine here again? No....actually I would if the layout was better.. :( As the food is brilliant..
4
My family of 3 had sumptuous dinner & the service staff were very efficient. Food was served promptly & didn’t disappoint - it was prepared with good quality. The lamb shank & beef burger were standout. Definitely recommend to try the food but do make reservations to avoid disappointment.
3
Service was not too bad but could be better. Food wise, the mains are great but appetisers and desserts not so much. A must try is the black cod! Also the surf and turf is very good. I Guess you’re paying for the Gordon Ramsay brand name and also for the place.

After watching Gordon Ramsay numerous times on youtube and cable. Finally decided to bring the Mrs for our wedding anniversary lunch.We were not disappointed, the service was very professional and epitomized Gordon's belief that 'the customer is the most important person in the restaurant'. We were given bread with more than enough butter for starters.Ordered the burger and fish n chips, as well as a cocktail (pineapple based). The food was fresh tasting, in accordance again to Gordon's philosophy of using seasoning to 'bring out the taste' rather than overwhelm it. The Mrs mentioned that the fish n chips was probably one of the best she has ever tasted, that says a lot going by her high standards and fussy eating habits. We also ordered the chocolate dessert and waited quite a time for it, the server (whose name I could not recall) immediately served up an alternative dessert (the chilled coconut ice cream) as a way of apologizing for making us wait. To me, that is a hallmark of excellent service.We're so impressed that I'm now persuading my parents to join us for lunch some time, if my mum gets impressed (and she is rarely impressed) I'm going to write a complimentary letter to the entire crew to Gordon Ramsay himself.Bill came up to $130? and there was no charge for the extra dessert given :

Overall it is a nice casual joint to meet friends or to have family gathering. The space is rather small so do expect to sit pretty close to other guests. Location: Near Expo at the Shoppe. Ask for 7 Eleven (it is across from it).Reservation: Highly recommended incase the restaurant is full.Beef Wellington: A MUST TRY! I have booked two weeks in advance via email. I have ordered the portion for 2, cost SGD160++. The portion of 2 is literally 250oz of beef stuffed with mushroom, and it comes with a side. You will need to confirm your booking via email by filling up an order form. Other things that I would recommend, -Buttermilk pancakes are to die for. I could eat that everyday!-The English Breakfast was delicious. - Had some cocktails over lunch. Pretty decent but nothing to shout about.Give it a try if you're in Singapore. Marina Bay Sands members can collect points while dining at this place. or you could bill it to your HOTEL ROOM! (YASSSSS). Oh - I didn't get the name of the lady who was serving my table, she was so wonderful. Keep it up. I will be back for sure

Went there for a couple beers. Looked like a nice bar/restaurant, and we could sit and wacth peolpe walking, jogging and bicycling by as we enjoyd a nice cold beer in the warm and humid weather. As a nice surprice, we got served homemade cookies for snack instead chips or peanuts. A delicate, surpricing touch :-

went for a quick pre-show dinner. I will highlight the positives first.on the whole the food that we had was well very well prepared, portions were sizeable. the kids liked their food. good kids menu with a reasonable selection and nice that the kids had some stuff given to them when we were taken to our table. my scallops were perfectly done, which shows a deft hand at the grill as they can be easy to get wrong. the kids had fish and chips and a burger which they also enjoyed. the wine menu looked well curated. we had two glasses of wine and both were good representatives for their region and grape. on the not so positive side, albeit relatively minor points.we were sat down. about 5 minutes later a couple were sat next to us. about 5 minutes after that I noted that they had been given the bread service. I waited but nothing was done for our table and I had to eventually call down a waitress to ask if we were going to have a bread service which eventually came. I really see no reason for why this was necessary. especially when the serving portion for the couple was the same size as ours. I wouldn't like to think that just because you are a family with kids, you get overlooked for European couples. we also had to wait quite a while between courses. coincidence or not, the tables next to us had theirs before ours.as stated above, the food was good generally and well presented. if I had one issue to raise it would be with regards to the roast duck. I had asked for a medium but it came out on the medium rare side. I would also have preferred a little more sear on the fat side of the duck as it came out a bit on the soft and chewy side.finally, given that dinner had run on a little longer than expected, I asked the waitress for the bill whilst we were still finishing up. I informed her that we had a show to catch. after a few minutes, the bill came, but instead of just waiting the 10 seconds that it would have taken me to take out my credit card, it was just left on my table and the waitress again disappeared. a few minutes passed, no one came back to get it and in the end, I had to waive down the front of house manager to pick it up for me.the final bill came to around 240.00. This was for two adult mains, two children main, two starters and two glasses of wine. I guess I would say the price is as expected for a restaurant at MBS. I wouldn't say it was good value, nor would I say it was expensive either. on the whole, we would certainly consider returning, but I only hope the service is better on return visits

My wife made a reservation and had my birthday dinner here. We ordered the fish&chips, pork belly, chicken wings, ceasar salad and 1 bottle of red wine. They also have free flow of bread which is also delicious. Received a surprised piece of cake and a birthday song from the staff before we left! Sat at the upper level which can see the view of CBD and Fullerton.Overall, the food is great, atmosphere is great and the staff are great too!

This is close to the marina bay sands. It has a great bay view. Food is excellent, service is good. Beers are expensive ($20 each). Desert at the bar is a great optio

We are always looking for places to eat when we visit the family in Singapore. The Bread Kitchen is reliably tasty European food in a good location...easy to park at their work and walk over to the Marina Bay Sands. Need to book unless you want to spend ages queueing outside...it always seems busy.Went for Sunday lunch, huge burgers with all the trimmings for the men, absolutely delicious blackened cod with fresh veg for us, and good kid's food (and entertainment pack)Service is really good, not obsequious, but efficient and kind. The young granddaughter loves being taken down to the desserts chef who lets her choose her own ice cream and loads of toppings herself from a huge range...nice touch.Prices for Singapore are reasonable. It's always full of locals, and is also a good choice for visitors. If you time it right in the evening you will be in the right place for the 'son et lumiere' lights show on the Marina too

I just went to the restaurant to have a try. The food was really nice and tasty. I choose seabass carpaccio and the pork belly. Both portion was huge and good. I didn't even had enough space to try a desert. Price are really reasonable for this location and type of restaurant. The lunch set menu is also very affordable. The staff were very nice and the ladies very beautiful. Will come back to try other dishes. Thank yo

Fish and chips at its best washed down with champers....holiday treat and thoroughly enjoyed every part of the experienc

From celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, this is a lovely looking and vibrant restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands complex. The place was humming and ultra full on a weekday (make sure to set reservations). The staff were very knowledgeable and akin to the type of service youâ€™d expect from a starred type restaurant. Just didnâ€™t give it five stars since I wasnâ€™t wowed by the food (I had the pork belly, which surprisingly had chewy skin instead of crispy.
4
Food was amazing! The scallops are one to try for, a little pricey for 3 pieces but so worth it (might even make you wanna order more!)I went for both the dinner and brunch.Brunch was slightly sad. None of us really enjoyed the food for brunch. Dinner was a complete difference! The duck and the risotto were so good.Will come back for dinner or maybe lunch! Yum

Excellent service and great food, just one downside for this restaurant is the toilets are in the shopping mall, not something you want to walk too when you're mid way through your meal. Mr R address this !

Booked for dinner two pax, business, during ITB - arrived at 8.15 pm as booked - waited for 6-8 minutes whilst hostess ( Caucasian with glasses) nosed the POS, she obviously had a problem finding our booking, & this lady was rude & unfriendly. She spent ages looking at her seating plan then finally told us we had to upstairs as table had just vacated. Took escalator to next level, - there immediately seemed to be an issue with the Air Conditioning and it was extremely warm, sticky and lacked fresh air - we were seated on a window table. Service was like the ambient atmosphere - luke warm, no smiles, no recommendations, had to wave my arm to get attention, ordered one kale and nut/carrot salad, plus an Irish Grass fed Rib eye (chewy) and Black Angus Sirloin also tough, one veg side order, one glass of rose and a bottle of water.Bread brought to the table wasn't fresh, we ran out of butter twice as the portion miniscule, Also had to ask for extra Béarnaise sauce which was very was runny and the black pepper sauce was orangey and luke warm.... bland, & so we were quite disappointed with the food quality, the steaks were a letdown, & neither of us ate much. At end of the night, they had some small Halloween candies wrapped in orange paper which we assumed they were a little treat giveaway, and we asked if I could take two ( One Each) for our kids, and picked them off the piled high tray. "No they are S$ 3.00 dollars each " replied the hostess ( Filipino in grey dress) asked us to put them back !! We felt embarrassed and humiliated like two naughty schoolboys who got caught with their hands in the cookie jar ( literally) ..and we were especially disappointed after having spent S$ 230 ++ on a really disappointing meal experience.I'm a hotelier from Hong Kong and if my staff behaved this was I'd be furious.The prices are exorbitant here & it seems to be an average restaurant cashing in on Gordon Ramsey's name... very disappointed & will not be returning.... Waste of Money. Don't bother. Plenty of better places

I went in with high expectations since this is one of Gordon Ramsays restaurants but I do think it's over rated.  I ordered the omelette with mushrooms, feta and rocket. It was presented as just the omelette not sides not even toast. The buttermilk pancakes were yummy but one was slightly undercooked. The AVO on toast hit the mark!! Oh and sadly they didn't have soy milk so I couldn't have a coffee. To be honest this one a major disappoint. I thought soy milk was syd tats even in average cafes and restaurants.

Gordon Ramsay's signature should always be something to take into account. And that's what I did.Food is fantastic. Fresh, pretty, good service... But lacks charm.And on top of that, what usually goes without saying in Singapore, this one is expensive.SGD$150 for two people having set lunch menu is too much while having a coke and a ice lemon tea for drinks.It was nice and I'm glad I visited, but no thank you.
5
This is a must visit when you are in Singapore, the setting looking out across the Marina Bay is fantastic, food and service is as you would expect of high quality, we were looked after fantastically and the whole experience was superb

The retiring is ok. It is missing some "charm" however it is ok to go for a business dinner or lunch. The manu has something for everyone (meat, fish, vegetarian) and is a combination between European and Asian.

We ate at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen around this time last year and the meal was excellent. I had the fish and chips which were the best fish and chips I have ever had. The chips were crisp and crunchy on the outside and fluffy and floury inside. Wonderful. The fish was fresh and the batter crisp. My wife had the lamb shank and absolutely loved it. We haven't stopped telling people how good the meal was since we arrived home and made a point of making an early booking as soon as we arrived at Marina Bay Sands on this trip.What a disappointment! Although my wife enjoyed her meal, mine was one of the worst meals I have had anywhere. Fish and chips - how can you go wrong?The chips were not hot when they arrived, were soggy and looked and tasted like they were reheated from lunchtime leftovers. The plate included several of those crunchy little unidentifiable burnt bits you get at the bottom of the chips from your cheap local corner fish and chip shop. The fish itself didn't smell like fish, but more like low tide on a hot day. It tasted OK to start with but got more chewy towards the ends. On looking closely at it I couldn't work out if the batter wasn't cooked and was sticking to the fish, or if the fish itself wasn't cooked properly. Either way I couldn't finish the plate.Although there were only around a half dozen other patrons in the restaurant at the time and the staff were certainly not busy, at no time did anyone come and ask how the meal was, or if there were any problems.When it was obvious I wasn't going to eat any more a waitperson came and took the plates away, again not asking if everything was OK. Shortly after another person asked if she could get anything else and we asked for the bill.Finally when we went to pay the cashier asked how everything was, but I really don't know why she bothered because when I explained the problems with the meal she just kept nodding and smiling, took our money and thanked us for coming.Coincidentally, earlier in the week I had the best fish and chip meal for lunch across the bay from this restaurant. There is a little seafood restaurant hidden away in the corner directly behind the Merlion. Excellent friendly service, lightly battered fresh fish and crunchy tasty chips and cheap Tiger beer, all at at cost of around a tenth of Bread Street. We will make sure we eat across the bay next time

Celebrated our Anniversary in this famous restaurant, been hearing loads of good reviews from my friends regarding this place. The whole place was really exquisite, simple design but made us feel at ease. Would like to commend on all the servers as they were all very attentive, and they wanted to make sure we had a good time. Ordered Seared Scallops, Roasted Black Cod and Monkey Shoulder Cranachan Cheesecake: All were really good, though the Scallop was a tad too salty. We particularly enjoyed the Black Cod as it was succulent, delicious and the potatoes that came with it was full of flavour. We both loved the Bread Basket and the Cookies they provided us before and after meal as well

My wife and myself went on a lunch date and this place was always on my mind, as i am a fan of Gordon's fish and chips. I have seen his video several times and always wanted to try it out. I didnt had high expectations from any other items in the menu as i knew it would be great. But for the fish and chips, i was slightly dissapointed with the chips as it was not sprinkled with paprika and parsley as i was hoping from his demonstration. Nonetheless, the service was great, staffs were attentive, food was delicious. The complimentary bread basket was nice and a good appetizer. All in all its a good casual restaurant at a superb location.

On meeting my nephew at the Pan Pacific Hotel we decided to go to breakfast at Marina Bay Area, and on the way he decided to look for Gordon Ramsay’s Bread Kitchen location in the Bay Area, and can I say he made the best choice for breakfast, it was fantastic. The Eggs Benedict was absolutely the tastiest with smoked salmon I ever tasted, my husband had the pancakes which he said left his taste buds in food heaven, absolutely scrumptious. Good coffee, good service and every staff member was so helpful at that time of the morning. On thanking my nephew for his choice, will all thanked the staff and left. Then with not me knowing my husband had booked the restaurant the following Friday night been the 6th for our 28th wedding anniversary, and I must say the staff were exceptional with all aspects of service and the teamwork in the restaurant was excellent. The food again on the night was as great as the breakfast the Sunday before but on a level much higher in tastes and textures that myself and my husband could not remember ever having,anywhere. A great night, and thanks to the staff made it a very special time for my husband and myself. Also we would like to thank the two heads for staff for the organisation of the head chef coming up to meet us and find out how we enjoyed the experience. It was an absolute anniversary to remember. Thanks again, Gordon would be proud of all your staff and yourselves. Give yourselves a big thumbs-up. 10/1

My family and I chose to go to Bread Street Kitchen for brunch to celebrate my dad's birthday and we had the best time. The food was absolutely incredible and the service was amazing. The employees took care of our needs and even prepared a little cake for my dad! They were nice and pleasant to talk to. The dishes came out as described on the menu and it is definitely worth the price, especially for a celebrity chef's restaurant. There is no doubt that we will be coming back very soon! Thank you for helping me make my dad's birthday memorable and amazing

When we entered the restaurant at 945pm, it was still fully packed. Majority of the guests are Caucasians with 1 to 2 tables who are Singaporeans. It can be quite noisy at times but I guessed it is part of the overall atmosphere, topped up with wines, beers and champagne.Although the wait staff highly recommended the fried chicken wings, we find that the sauce that the wings are marinated in too salty.The Beef Burger however was tasty, beef patty that was cooked to the right doneness that we requested, fries serving was generous.The Stracciatella Milk Shake can do better, though. Overall, if you are looking for an happening evening with your few friends, American Food with affordable pricing, Bread Street Kitchen is highly recommended
4
The atmosphere was great, the food delicious, the service attentive and the location perfect. We went for lunch, there is a lunch deal 40SGD++/person for 2 courses and it goes from 11.30-4. Perfect if you have a big hotel breakfast and are looking for a late lunch. The food choices for very good, I took 3 picky teenagers and we all found something that we liked. There was a lovely touch at the end when the staff brought out a jar of cookies and we were able to help ourselves. Small thing but delightful

Average restaurant with expensive prices. Steaks were cooked well and taste great, but not worth the price. Greens were minimal.Service was great.

I have been to this restaurant before and sat at the bar with a few snacks and a glass of wine. I enjoyed it. However, recently I visited with my sister and niece when they were in Singapore for a couple of nights on their way from Canada to Australia. We had to wait a few mins for a table and were offered a table in the small outdoor section. That was not a problem because they had just spent 23 hours in the plane and it was a very nice night in Singapore. When we were seated at the table outside there was huge noisy industrial fan right beside us and it was blowing a gale. We had a difficult time speaking over it and my sister was getting blown to bits. We asked them to turn it off and they did but the table of 2 beside us complained that it was too warm outside. Not a good experience and at all and this fan was ridiculous in such an expensive (for what is offers) restaurant. Rather than battle with the rude couple beside us, I asked for table inside and they did come up with one eventually. Service was a bit slow. We had to ask for our glasses of wine 3 times. The food was good but overall I was not that impressed. What is happening there Gordon

After kilometres of walking around the High End shops of which every third was another Watch brand - how many watches can you wear? In all my travels I have never seen so many Watch Brands in one centre. Anyway we just had to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen and what else would you order Pie and Chips or Fish and Chips with Mushy Peas - we dined on the latter and in Gordon Ramsay's vernacular it was ****** good
5
Went for dinner twice in the last couple of weeks while visiting Singapore. Atmosphere was fantastic, service was friendly and attentive and food was tasty. We had Pork belly, Duck, fettuccine and salads, along with drinks and all were well presented and tasty. I would highly recoomend this restaurant
5
My family is a great fan of Masterchef Gordon Ramsey so in our trip to Singapore, we made sure we sample his restaurant. We were apprehensive that it's all hype and we were crossing our fingers that we wouldn't get disappointed! We reserved for dinner, and as we entered the place, the great service begun!The host and waiters were gracious and always made sure we were taken cared of.Just like any English pub, the place was dark and a little noisy. But we totally forgot those details when the food came.DELICIOUS!!! We ordered three appetizers. Scallops were to die for!The burger was sooo huge, my daughter couldn't finish it, although she was really trying! I had the pork belly -yummy!!! The Fish and chips - super! Well, the Mac and Cheese was just ok, according to my 10-year old. But desserts quickly turned him around, enough for him to proclaim that it was one of the best dinners ever
4
We enjoyed our late lunch at this place. Food is great since we ordered crispy pork belly with a very tasty sauce considering that i ordered a smoothie the taste do not over power each other. The crew are very nice as we are seated at the bar as we do not have reservations. The view right now is covered by some renovations in marina but we enjoyed the busy bustling of the bar activity
4
My family tried the Longhorn Steak, while I had the fish n chips. The medium-done steak was too tough for my liking, but the fish n chips was very very good. The batter was very crispy and the lingcod was brilliant. I will return for the fish n chips again. Last but not least, the service by the crew was impeccably good.
5
Just called in for a quick drink and from the very moment we entered the atmosphere was fantastic. William the bar manager needs a pay rise, he makes you feel welcome from the very second you catch his eye. The beer is great, the cocktails are lovely and the staff actually know enough to advise. The chocolate fondant desert is to die for. We even had a tour of the whole place, including the kitchen. Go here for a drink as a minimum and enjoy the level of service, you deserve at least once in your life. Fab. That all there is to it!
5
*late review*finally can tried the celebrity chef restaurant, gordon ramsay . Had a good lunch here!celebrated our 15 monthsary lunch here with my boyfie while were holiday at SG last month . the foods are superrrrrrr amazing âœ¨really like my appetizer , the salmon was so good and super freshhhh . i'll come back again to your restaurant gordon till we meet again
5
The food here is wonderful, even the Burger and Fries is great.Service is also great and the outlook is nice if you are sitting in the open windows at night with a wine and capturing that city view.This is well worth trying
4
Nice place for a coffee break when u reached 10k steps.Very friendly staff. Nice bread basket.They offer free cookies while bill is being settled....free cookies!!
4
This was a highly enjoyable experience, great food, great service a good wine selection and they cater for children. Really give this one a try you will not be disappointed. Enjoy the experience
1
Music way too loud.Food too dry/blend.Chickens slightly under cooked.Steak a bit over done for medium rare.Service is great but a bit understaffed.Competitors too good
5
booked for a 4:30pm meal but the play we watched ended earlier so walked in at 4pm. they got available table for me and my friend. the waiters are very gracious. we have a misconception that since its a gordon ramsay resto it must be very expensive but hell no. it is reasonably priced! the salad is a big serving and its good for sharing. even the main meal steak is cooked just right and very juicy. they they serve free cookies after the meal which tasted heavenly. the resto is a bit warm but i suspect it is because of their lighting. i will definitely come back again. such a pleasant place!
4
Had dinner here after a week of local food and wanted a break. Sat by the window which had a great view of the bay, interior was nicely done and had a good atmosphere. We found the food to be good and the service attentive. We split the short rib burger, which was perfectly cooked, plus they have a pretty good wine selection. It was a Wednesday night so not very busy. Nice change of pace
4
Walked in here by accident not knowing it was a Ramsay restaurant but was pleasantly surprised by the food and the gin selection. I had a great French gin called G'Vine which is a grape based gin mixed with a botanical tonic. Fantastic. Very different to what I normally have but was smooth and great to drinkFood for me was a featherside steak with mash and kale. The steak was perfectly tender, moist and just enough char on it to provide a good flavour. The mash was smooth and creamy and the kale was the right greenery to offset the flavours. Not too expensive and in a great location by the bay
5
The menu was appealing and not too expensive, bearing in mind the impressive location. The service was friendly and efficient. An excellent restaurant
2
Decided to go here for a late Sunday lunch before the Singapore Grand Prix, decision made on back of an enjoyable meal experienced at their London restaurant near St Pauls.Big mistake!!Flat bread with ham with butternut squash starter was stodgy and bland,followed by 2 Burgers, one supposedly medium and the other medium well. Both arrived raw and were returned,second delivery no better and definite odour of the meat being slightly off.Management did not charge for the burgers.Service was reasonably good but food was terrible, would not return
3
We have been to this place a few times and they have always been fantastic, but today my wife's blue cheese pasta was extremely oil. I had the crispy duck salad and I also was disappointed with my mine. The crispy duck was very hard to eat and chew. The kids meals were excellent and our tamarind wings were unreal ! Service was good and quick. But unfortunately today's meal didn't hit the spot!
4
A local colleague suggested the restaurant for our get-together, and it worked in excellent fashion for a business lunch. The wide variety of interesting mains suited our range of tastes, with the Aussie going for the steak, and two of us taking different pasta dishes (mine was with the Stilton cream sauce and sun-dried tomatoes). We shared a bottle of wine (pricey, but hey, that's Singapore) and the atmosphere was conducive to a nice catch-up among close associates. Not a real taste of Singapore, but a strong international choice that won't offend anyone
4
Bread Street Kitchen offers good food, well prepared with unusual choices and a great atmosphere. We enjoyed a pre-theater dinner here with some great cocktails from the extensive gin menu and good British/European starters & mains. The staff are friendly and attentive, the food served at our pace. Definitely come back with a group for a fun night out. You don't have to spend a fortune or endure white linen tablecloths to enjoy good food, done with style

We are really big fans of Gordon Ramsey's shows and we are always amazed by his extraordinary attention to perfection - from using the freshest ingredients, to delivering the best flavour, to cooking at the right temperature, to providing an artistic presentation, and finally providing excellent service. These values are truly represented in the TV shows and should come as no surprise he has multiple Michelin star restaurants in his management. This is *unfortunately* not the case of Bread Street Kitchen, a Kitchen Disaster of sorts that does a really terrible job of representing the Gordon Ramsey brand, especially in Singapore. As he may say "Absolutely Dreadful!"Along with the family, we ordered a Fish n Chips, a Burger, a kids Burger, a kids Caesar Salad, and a kids Pasta. All very simple dishes which should not require too much work and should be easy to master and perfect. In fact, both the Burger and the Fish n Chips are dishes which Gordon Ramsey commonly excoriates in Kitchen Nightmare restaurant episodes - and applies his magic - and et voila the restaurant gets saved! So these dishes should be a "no brainer" - for both the cook and the customer! Fish n Chips was good - nice crispy texture outside, solid mushy peas, nice elegant texture inside. Chips were cooked well in the right colour and seasoning. All in all a good effort - a B+ fish in chips and a solid showing.The Two burgers (one kids and one adult), however, were "Absolutely Dreadful!" Probably the most unbelievably inconsistent service I've experienced - we ordered (and confirmed) one Burger without cheese, and one Kids Burger plain (confirmed just patty and bun). And it required three attempts and re-service to try to get it right. All in all, One mistake is acceptable. Two mistakes is problematic. But three mistakes is incompetence and represents a systemic problem of restaurant management! Some pictures below of the adult burger and the fries at the end - but here's the qualitative / quantitative feedback on the burger - after three rounds.- Flavour was gamey with a gristly texture. The menu touts 7 oz of short rib beef mix on a fresh bun - but the burger must have either been frozen or have not included proper mixing and grinding. Had a slight tinge of lamb and if there was a flavour for cat food - the burger would have it. Maybe this is Singapore meat quality but I've had significantly better meat burgers at Daniel Boulud across the MBS, the Burger in the Islamic District, or Omakase Burger in Wisma.- Ingredients were not fresh, especially with the bun, which was slightly stale with a chewy crust and a dry interior. It certainly didn't taste freshly made or freshly cooked. And, add the comment above on the Meat it was disappointing, especially one of the key values Gordon applies in every Kitchen Nightmare is the use of fresh ingredients!- Cooking was absolutely inconsistent. Ok, this was the biggest disappointment. First burger ordered medium well, came extremely well done and dry. Unfortunately, the dryness of the meat was exacerbated with the dry bun. Then for the second round, the burger was cooked acceptably but was missing all of the ingredients (see below) so I asked for the raw materials to self-assemble the burger. Furthermore - the fries were well over cooked and dry (see below)- Presentation was acceptable. Thankfully, no marks taken away here - as it's simply fries in a can, a burger, and some wax paper. Phew!- Service was very late and extremely subpar. Our simple order of kids Caesar salad, kids pasta, kids burger, fish n chips, and an adult burger took well over an hour, with the reservice at the end taking well over 30 minutes. As per above, they messed up *three times* and it is as if the service staff and the management *Does Not Care* about the quality of the service especially when there is an error or two errors or three. We did not experience any urgency nor attention to the matter - but ironically just slower and poorer service and delivery of quality food. I was visualizing Gordon Ramsay yelling "service" in the back of the kitchen but in this case there was more "ignorance" and perhaps "incompetence" This was the biggest disappointment of all! At the end of the meal - we did get the two burgers comped - and were offered complimentary desserts - which was a nice gesture but clearly did not make up for the significant shortfalls in ingredients, flavour, cooking, and service - on one of the most fundamental and foundational menu items in any restaurant. Me and my family were extremely disappointed with the experience and I believe it certainly has the potential to taint his reputation as being an extraordinary artist and world class chef - Bread Street Kitchen was a big disappointment and is in need of a Kitchen Nightmare revamp as soon as possible. Neither Gordon Ramsey nor the General Manager nor the Head Cook can accept this and need to consider changes.If you want good burgers - try somewhere else - like Daniel Boulud db Bistro (in the MBS) or Cut (in the MbS) or elsewhere. To be fair - The two stars instead of one star is due to the solid Fish n Chips, and Caesar Salad, as well the comping.

We had a magnificent meal here on our last night in Singapore. I organised a pre-ordered Beef Wellington and was not disappointed. It was packed full of flavour and the beef was deliciously soft. And perfectly cooked. The service was impeccable and there was a great casual vibe. Highly recommended.
3
What a beautiful location, great view. The food was terribly disappointing, and the service was slow and a little sloppy.
4
We didn't realize this was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant when we went... just happened upon the place when strolling the mall. Food was excellent as was service and drinks. I thought the cookie jar was an outstanding idea that could easily be copied by other restaurants. P.S. Bread basket was also delicious with a nice sampling of breads
3
Sorry but I ate the pictures before taking them... Decided to try Gordon Ramsey's food and recipes to see how they turnout. Started with two appetizers, the tamarind spiced chicken wings and the tuna tartar with crispy wantons. First the wings. They were probably the worst wings I have ever encountered. It had a hard breaded shell with an overly sweet (no hint of the tamarind) sauce. The colder the wings got the tougher they became. Second the tuna tartar. The tuna was almost flavorless except for some sesame oil which is fairly mild. The crispy wonton skins made up for the dish.For the entree, my dining partner and I decided to try the roasted pork belly with an apple chutney/roulade. The pork had the skin left on and it was roasted into a hard crust. Furthermore the crust was quite heavily salted that it made it difficult to. It sat in a soy sauce based sauce which made it saltier and difficult to cut into even with a steak knife. The saving grace was the pork itself was cooked perfectly and was not too fatty as pork belly can tend to be. The apple chutney was excellent and went well with the pork meat.Service was very good and the servers were more than attentive. The bread bowl came out quickly and so did our waters. Even though the bottle of water sat onour table. The servers would refill our glasses periodically.The bottom line is that I am not sure if I will make an effort to visit here again
4
Great restaurant! Lovely atmosphere and attentive staff. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. My only criticism was that the seasonal vegetables were very bland. The cookie jar with coffee was a nice touch though
5
We had a late lunch here and it was just what we'd hoped for. We shared the tamarind chicken nibbles which was super tasty and then we both had the beef burger and fries. It was delicious! Service was great too
5
Always wanted to visit a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The hype is jusrified. Great place for drinks, great service, great location considering it was my first time at Marina Bay Sands.The steak was great, cooked to perfection
5
Had the most enjoyable lunch in this restaurant a few days back. Highly recommended for quality, service and value for mone

A wonderful atmosphere and super attentive service! We had the Sunday roast and it was delightful. Make sure you leave some room for the desserts

After being a fan of MC US for years...and now rooting for Dino and Jason...found myself being waifed in the direction of BSK MBS....Lots of activities this weekend at MBS as they are tying up with Comm Chest for a giving back weekend...Apparently they were running full this weekend...As expected it was a Caucasian magnet. As a fan of avocado, tried the brekkie toast. Delicious and generous portion of the green stuff on German rye bread. A tough fight with the Providore's version of smashed Avocado on toast.Might return to try their mains....esp. their signature Fish and Chips.Friendly wait staff and bar tender. the Caucasian lady manning the front of the house had a chip on her shoulder...Not too friendly with Asians but very familiar with her breed. Not a professional approach. Not the first time encounter at BSK...Had a similar experience weeks ago when a taller Caucasian gave us the once over and lied about brekkie hours.Hopefully they will improve on their front of the house. People who make enquiries or just walkin for take outs should be equally valued as those who are of your colour and creed. It is about self respect. and these two ladies left us wondering what their parents taught them growing up

Visited Bread Street Kitchen with my son today as my son is a big fan. Many office professional having meal there during lunch hour. After office lunch hour many families with children filling the tables. We were lucky to get a table as a walk in customer. Recommended to reserve a table online before visiting. The staffs are super friendly and very professional. Dress code: smart casual. They can recommend dishes for you if you told them what you like/dislike. The restaurant served breads as entree and jar of cookies at end of our meal, free of charge. We order Burger (comes with french fries) for my son, Baby Chicken and mash potatoes for myself and Salad with watermelon and pumpkin seeds to share. And sharing vanilla & cherry ice cream for dessert. The foods and dessert are well presented and delicious with generous portion. We are really full after the meal. They have good selection of wines as well. And the location is next to the bay so the view is very nice. Upon knowing that my son is a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, one of the male staff with hairband (forgot to ask for his name), arranged for us to tour the kitchen & meet the head Chef, Sabrina (lovely lady) who gave my son an autograph photo of Gordon Ramsay :) And when she found out my son's birthday was only few days ago, the staffs did the extra mile by giving him chocolate cake with candles and sing for him :) :) This really makes our day. Thank you Mr. Gordon Ramsay and ESPECIALLY all staffs at Bread Street Kitchen. Highly recommended. We will definitely be back :

Well services was ok. This is my second visit. Last visit service was good too but the food itself doesn't impressed me. So as this time. There are so many restaurants has better and more impressed food without the celebrity name tag. By the way, this is my last visit. No more in future. Goodbye!

The food here is incredible! I had the blackened cod and my partner had the duck, both dinners were lovely! The drinks were a bit steeply priced but then considering the location I'd say we expected that. We were also given complementary fresh bread at the beginning of our meal and cookies at the end which was a pleasant little extra. The staff were extremely attentive which was lovely but it was a bit Over the top as every member of staff came over several times we appreciate the effort but maybe a bit of communication between servers may have helped to avoid us being asked several times if we wanted a drink or deserts or if our meal was pleasant. All in all a great spot with fab food.

Four of us visited this restaurant for lunch, hoping to taate the famous Gordon Ramsey cooking. Right from the start, we had waited for over 30 min to get a server to take order, after requesting for services from 3 different servers. The place was not even full, how busy can they be? understaffed or efficiency issue? That's exactly the type of things you see in Hell's Kitchen, before the revamp. The bread in this Bread Street restaurant is very blend, no wow. the spriit of a restaurant is in the details!! My main dish, duck breast the as good. my colleagues medium T bone was hard like a rock, rejected.Desert was good. Thus, overall experience is so-so, lots of room for improvement.

Food ok but not great... definitely not worth the wait. Service was below standard best was fish and chip

As the title suggests, Bread street kitchen (Bsk) sure has made a great impression on our first visit. We made a booking for a birthday dinner, one week in advance to secure a table. Bear with me as I go into details.Service:Upon arrival last Friday, we were ushered to our table, and we walked past many staff members who joyfully greeted us. It was surprising! Not many local restaurants are that friendly - a true UK experience.Our waiter was friendly and had good product knowledge. He recommended popular dishes and when asked its ingredients and sides, he knew perfectly about the food's composition. Waiters and waitresses in general were attentive and cheerful. Food:Bread and butter basket - It's free flow! Always nice to have a B&B basket to fill our empty stomachs while waiting for food.Dingley dell roast pork belly - Generous portion! The skin was cracking and really crispy. The meat was flavourful and succulent. It was paired with apple purré. The waiter mentioned it was to balance out the dish.It's sweet with salty. I liked the purré, not too sweet and not too thick. My only gripe was that the skin was too hard, couldn't cut with my knife. But it didn't matter, this dish was fantastic! Must definitely order!Caveat lector! There's no side dish other than the purré so one should consider ordering a side. (Or just pair it with the bread.)Angus sirloin steak -Cooked medium-well, well flavoured and juicy. Not too bad a dish. Sauce and seasoning was good. Worth a try! Fish and Chips - Great British Standard! Easily comparable to a traditional UK outlet. Batter was crispy and the fish was firm and cooked well. Worth a try!Roast black cod - Fish was too soft, not really flavourful and rather "soaked". Not that roasted I believe. Portion was small. Not worth for the price paid. May pass on this.Overall experience / tl;dr : Grade A- (4/5)Great first impression - a go to place for a birthday party. The staff even sang for the birthday boy! Lovely ambience and atmosphere; food still has room for improvement but still, it's up there, living up to Gordon's name.

Fantastic customer service welcomes you to the BSK. Overlooking marina bay it's in a great location.The food was delicious with a nice array of Asian and English themed dishes. From chili salmon tartare with wonton crisps to old fashioned fish and chips with mushy peas, there's something for everyone.We were also dining with someone who was gluten free, and were very impressed by the fact that each allergy/food preference has their own menu (which basically includes many of the same non-allergy options or altered versions of them). These menus also looked identical to the normal ala carte ones. A very professional no fuss way to manage those with allergies/food pretences without making a fuss.Moderately priced but definitely worth it. Will be back

I had for starter fois gras and for the main Mushroom Risotto; my husband Angus. Simply delicious. I think the risotto was the best that I have ever tried. The dessert was good but nothing exceptional. The receptionist is a little insistent and offered a table at the bar saying the restaurant was full; when I decided to give up, right away she found a table...anyway, good experience. 1 starter shared for 2, 1 risotto, 1 angus, 1 bottle of water and 2 glasses of Italian wine, 1 cheesecake and 1 coffee expresso around 150 euros

As per my younger son requested so many time for Goren Ramsay- bread street kitchen, we was so reluctant to go for fine dining there after had try Osteria Mozza. However, was great that we went there for lunch on last day of our trip in Marina Bay Sand. It turn out a wonderful meal for us, my family love the food they serve with quality & cooked with passion. They served bread before main course whereby my kids took so much as it was so delicious. The chocolate desserts taste good as it wasn't too sweet yet rich. Well done & Keep it up the quality...Bread Street Kitchen.

Had dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen, pretty disappointed for the price paid. With a welcoming & knowledgeable staff and a huge diversity of cocktails, the quality of food had to be way above the "average" level. Bland & dry burger, the burrata could've been more flavorful with the side dishes being nothing more than "ok". Better luck next time (maybe)

Impressed by the mini portion of fish and chips durinf Epicurean Market 2017, I had high expectation to the full serving size in BSK today, only to get utter disapppointment by the soggy fish. It's definitely not as firm and tasty as the mini version. It's so mushy that I have to spoon it using fork. No firmness nor freshness. Not sure how the crushed peas is supposed to taste like, but it's flavorless. Completely different from other photos in many reviews where it looks like creamy mashed peas. Mine is literally crushed peas.The only redeeming factor is the professionalism in service and the pairing of bread and fragrant butter.

Had a wonderful dinner with my husband, and from the beginning of booking to the end was a pleasant experience. Great old fashion service, very helpful and accommodating and keep topping up the wine (we don't even get this in Perth at a 5 star restaurant) so was pleasant. Situated in the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Centre. Enjoyed Ramsays Beef Wellingtons (to be fair was a bit shocked at the price at $80 each!) wouldn't say they were the best I've had but never less we enjoyed them. We're lucky as I booked last minute and hadn't pre ordered the Wellingtons as it's been mentioned so we're greatful we order them. Not sure they may have had a few spare going. Great wine selection and enjoyed birthday chocolate brownie. Thanks to Gordon and the team most memorable evening.
5
As you would expect, the quality was fab, service was great. The price was reasonable - worth booking as gets busy. Breakfast at weekends only
5
A first class meal with excellent service and nice location looking over the bay. The food was everything you would expect from one of Gordon's restaurants. It's not cheap but you certainly don't feel like you overpaying considering the quality of the food being served.
5
Sensational... great dining experience. The staff were extremely accommodating, fitting us in when main dining area was full so thank you for that. Food, cocktails and service was top notch... a special congratulations dessert was a nice touch and unexpected.. highly recommended. Nice job guys. Cheers Darren & Dalla

We got a table only at 930pm. Had the kale salad, it was refreshingly simple with oranges and pomegranates. Our mains were Fish and Chips and Beef Burger. Burger was average. The bun was falling apart. The fish was good, thick and crispy. We shared a chocolate fondant with chocolate mint ice cream. A nice touch at the end of the meal, you are given a jar of cookies! I was pleased by that gesture.

Went to this restaurant for lunch as a family with one child. No booking, it was busy. The staff were great, seated us overlooking water. Great service and food. Made my son so happ

I was looking forward to dining at this restaurant. First impressions are important and Bread St Kitchen failed. We had a booking but still had to wait before being redirected upstairs in a rather officious manner. While waiting we could see straight through the open kitchen where a staff member was washing dishes.The restaurant was cramped. Food was good but not memorable. Service was polite and prompt, and hurried. It did not give a sense of relaxed dining experience. Would I return again ? probably not
3
We went there for breakfast. I really had high hopes for this restaurant given Gordon Ramsay's association, but it wasn't to be. It wasn't busy at all yet service was quite slow. The setting was missing a fork, which I ended up having to take from another table because I couldn't get any staff's attention. Spiced Scrambled eggs were on the dry side and seemed flavourless. Pancakes were average - needed more maple syrup to be provided with the serving. When you are paying $75 SD you expect better

We wanted to treat ourselves with a nice meal on our last day in Singapore, and decided to visit Bread Street Kitchen since we like watching Gordon Ramsay and wanted to go somewhere family-friendly and casual.The decor and ambience of this place is phenomenal. Waiters are extremely polite and VERY professional in every aspect.We ordered the Rib-eye, the Sirloin and the Lamp chops, and everything came out very good. Our only disappointment was the Sirloin, which was a bit undercooked (should've been medium) and too thick to cut properly. We chose to eat it anyway, since it was late and we had to catch an early flight the next day. All in all a great experience, although a bit overpriced for what it was
5
A need to try in Singapore. The place is really nice and service super. Gordon Ramsey footprint in the dishes is really something that you need to try if you like the good food. We had linguine with crab meet as starters and a risotto served with parmesan chees and mashrums as main course and as Italian I have to say everything was extremely good. the service is very efficient and helping you with smiling faces. Prices are ok for the kind of resturant and location (we spent in average the equivalent of not more than 40â‚¬ each). Service is 10% and taxes are 7% (to be considered when ordering- but a disclaimer is clearly exposed on the manu).all in all super experience in a wonderful location with view on the Ba
3
We have been frequenting pretty much since the place opened as my lovely Wife is a big fan.To be brutally honest we still go because my lovely Wife is still a fan. Don't get me wrong, it has a good atmosphere, the staff are great, but whether we are there as a couple or a bigger group, there is always one meal that just doesn't do it.Come on Gordon, it's all about consistency.I gave an average rating because very good it isn't, good perhaps

Looking For GF Options ( I Have Coeliac Disease) In Singapore Requires Detective Work, So Was Happy To Find This Place Had A Selection Of GF Options Available On Their Menu.A Good location On Bayfront Ave - If You Dont Mind Joggers, Skateboarders And Stickybeaks Looking In At You Whilst Eating Looking Over To The Merlion And Singapore City.The Staff Were Friendly And Attentive - No Gordon Ramsey In The Kitchen? .The Food Was Lovely- Delicious and Hot. I Ordered A GF Burger Whilst My Wife Had The Pork Belly. The Servings Were Just The Right Size For Us And Was Washed Down With a Cider And NZ White. We Followed Up With An Ice Cream Cup - Standard Fare Anywhere. The Restaurant Was Quite When We Arrived However Was Packed By The Time We Departed So Must Be Popular, Maybe Booking Would Be Required At Certain Times. Sorry Jamie We Have Been To Your Restaurant In Adelaide And It Pales To This In The Quality Of Food. The Prices Were Reasonable I Believe So Its A Recommend From Me

I had dinner before some days in "Bread Street Kitchen" with my wife. It was our first visit to a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant and were very enthousiastic about it with high expectations. Although we hadn't made any reservations, a table was immediately available for us. The staff was generally polite and professional. The order was correctly and quickly executed.We ordered 2 starters, the seared scallops and the "Flatbread, butternut squash, Taleggio cheese, San Daniele ham, rocket pesto": the scallops were fantastic, but the flatbread had far too many flavours for our taste, so we left it almost untouched except for the ham. The waitress didn't show any interest why this starter was left almost uneaten, as I would have expected as a sign of care for the client.For mains we had the slowly roasted pork belly, that was very good, and the "Braised featherblade steak, mashed potato, sage pesto, fried shallot rings, kale", that was tasteless and was also left half-eaten. We were so frustrated, that we didn't order any desserts.We would not recommend this particular restaurant as a sign of Gordon Ramsay's culinary skills
5
Been travelling for 3 months and as a treat stayed at Marina Bay Sands and had a meal here. We hadn't eaten in a restaurant of this calibre since leaving the uk and we were dead impressed. I had the scallops followed by pork belly and my partner had the duck. All dishes were bursting with flavour and the bread you're given at the start was some of the best I have ever had. Washed down with a little lovely bottle of French red wine from their extensive list and we came away happy bunnies. The place was buzzing with an international crowd and the whole night was great ! Highly recommend it but expect London or higher prices.
4
Was here with my overseas guests and everyone loves the food here. However, it took quite some time to get us a table even though there were some empty tables around (i believe they are quite short handed). It was not easy to be waiting outside as the entrance was quite narrow and we were blocking other customers as well... Probably we were expecting better service since this is a restaurant by Gordon Ramsay... Service can definitely be faster
4
I admittedly did not have high expectations for Gordan Ramsay's restaurant, Bread. My only exposure to Gordon is as a brash TV personality. I was secretly looking forward to trashing the quality of food at Bread.We arrived a little on the late side for dinner with no reservations. The hostess was able to seat us at a table in the lower level of the restaurant. I was overwhelmed by the noise. Definitely not a spot for the hard of hearing or a romantic dinner!As a starter, I ordered the seared scallops. It is one dish that you cannot cover up poor product with an excellent technique nor an excellent product mask a poor product. Wow these were amazing!On to the mains, my companion's pasta was perfect with just the correct texture; not too soft and not too crunchy. The sauce was a perfect match with the pasta. For me, the chips were excellent but oh the burger. It must have been prepared by the 6th guy. You know the one they kicked out of Five Guys. Cardboard and soy instead of bread and meat. Seriously it was not that bad but Gordon you can do better!Service was a bit frantic but appropriate for the atmosphere of a noisy and busy place.Overall I have to give Bread a thumbs up
5
Kudos to Gordon Ramsay for maintaining the standard of pleasant good service and food menu is reasonable, presentable and delectable accompanied by variety of cocktails, wine and mocktails too. Lapse in service on our first visit was redeemed by william the bar manager and all is good again. Special thanks to Jenna Lauren Sendall, the Restaurant Manager in directing her staff to ensure we have a good recovery dining experience. We truly enjoy our night there with good food and drinks but most importantly the experience that we went through our dining time. This is THE restaurant if you want a total good experience in dining. Gordon Ramsay really know how his thing! Till next time we come again.

We first came to Bread Street soon after its opening and there were quite a few wrinkles to iron out for service, menu and price.This time, I visited with my family as a wedding anniversary treat and I have to say that things are much better in every respect. The only slight blot on the almost perfect score comes from a slightly unnecessarily officious maitre d' and a slightly hit and miss menu.As part of the warm welcome, we received a complimentary tasting flight of amuse bouche items and I have to say, these were quite brilliantly done. We also received a small cake with "Happy anniversary " piped around the plate at the end of the meal. This would have been an excellent end to our meal had it not been for the fact that the cake itself was dry and overbaked.The menu items we chose showed some of Gordon's flair and the was a very hearty silverside dish that was tender and well balanced. Sea trout was well prepared but slightly beyond pink in the middle meaning that it was slightly dry and had lost that juicy moistened that is so important to a fish dish.Overall, I would give this a 4.5 rating. So close in many respects but just a little ragged in places. Credit to chef Costas who made some great recommendations and who clearly has been whipping the team into shape downstairs

Great looking restaurant and bar , food delicious although portion size average ,side dishes on the small size.Staff really friendly , variations requested to one of our meals not met which was a bit disappointing as peppermint was definitely not wanted . Over all total a. It expensiv

Food was good. But it could have been better, if the staff who came over to ask about the taste of the food could look me in the eyes while I talk to him than into the eyes of my missus. Or maybe I had came from home and was dressed down and my wife was in her office attire. Not that I am very eager to engage in the conversation, but I certainly do not enjoy being brushed aside. My wife laughed at me for being the loser and volunteered to pick up the tab. She was the one being showered with all the attention anyway. (grumble) :DThe food was good nonetheless. But I wouldn't return personally. I must admit I am not a graceful person to begin with (that I must apologise), and I don't think I will be missed anyway. :

I have lunched at Bread Street Kitchen before and recalled the food to be fantastic. So when I had my staycation at MBS just this weekend, I already knew I'd be dining here again during my stay.First off, the food. I have been to Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in London and was expecting Bread Street Kitchen to pale in comparison to its fine dining cousins in the UK. However, even though this is just a casual dining restaurant, the food is nothing short of excellent. I guess Gordon Ramsay really lives up to his reputation and ensures quality in the food served in all of his restaurants instead of simply riding on the reputation of it being part of a celebrity chef chain (anyone who has dined at Jamie's Italian at Vivocity will know what I'm talking about). I highly recommend the Spicy Salmon Tartare! You'll crave for more!Best of all? The price! One would expect a celebrity chef restaurant to charge exorbitant prices, but the price of the food here is very reasonable! In fact, they are comparable to the many average restaurants here in Singapore. Definitely value for money.Now, we've all probably watched enough of Gordon Ramsay's shows to know that he demands excellent service as much as great food from his restaurants. And I must say that the staff at Bread Street Kitchen didn't disappoint. From the hostesses at the door to the servers who attended to us throughout our meal, each of them served us with warm smiles and friendly demeanor, constantly checking in to top up our drinks, asking how our food was, and if we needed anything else. In fact, we enjoyed our dinner so much, both food and service, that we decided to come back again the next morning for breakfast. Now this is where my whole great dining experience at Bread Street Kitchen was left tainted. The hostess was still as warm and friendly, even recognising me to have dined here the night before and welcoming me back! However, the server that attended to us was horrible. There was no smile on her face, and she looked pained to be serving us. We know ourselves to be great customers because we are always kind and friendly to service staff, and I believe that's why we always get great service in return. So her bad service was definitely not due to us being bad customers. It's a classic case of double standards by asian servers - you could see her smiling from ear to ear when attending to caucasian customers, seemingly so eager to serve. Very disappointing. To make matters worse was her attitude when I was placing my order. I had ordered English Breakfast and she asked how I would like my eggs done. I asked if it can be done eggs benedict style. Now I understand this not to be standard but any restaurant with great service would accede to this simple request and politely inform of extra charges where necessary. Even if it's not possible, a basic "I'm sorry sir but we can only serve sunny side up / scrambled" would suffice or at least an attempt to check with the kitchen would have been great. Our server instead had a scowl on her face when I made the request. A scowl! Only after I persisted, all this time asking very nicely mind you, that she mentioned "ok but there is extra charge", as if my simple request was costing her her life! Did I mention that she did not even understand what I meant when I asked for eggs benedict? I had to explain to her "poached eggs with hollandaise sauce" before she finally got it! Now who is the one working in a restaurant?I was going to call the manager to lodge a complaint but decided not to as I have really enjoyed our weekend staycation and really do not want it tainted at the end by this horrible server. The saving grace? We saw another server who served us as well last night and got her to attend to us instead. She was wonderful.As highlighted in the title of my review, my great experience here at Bread Street Kitchen has been let down by 1 staff. This was the only reason I gave it 4 stars when I would have gladly given it 5. I really hope the restaurant gets to read this review and would pay attention to how one staff can bring the whole dining experience of its customers down. This is coming from one who really appreciates good service - we tipped both the gentlemen that attended to us during dinner last night and the lady who served us both times, to encourage them to continue their great service.If you're asian, avoid this server. I wished I had asked for her name. She is perhaps the shortest in the restaurant, with a very round head and big eyes. Her attire seemed slightly different from the rest of the female servers during breakfast, wearing something like a vest. I certainly hope she's not a senior staff by that attire cos she certainly does not deserve to be one
5
Stumbled upon the place while out on a morning walk with friends last Sunday. So love my breakfast that I'm back today and again, it was delicious. The service is brilliant, service team is attentive and warm in spite of being crowded. Love it so much that I'm heading back here for dinner tonight.
3
Went on a week day for corporate celebratory lunch. There were a number of options on the menu and we took a while to decide. Staffs could be better trained to share Chef's recommendations or provide more details on the dishes on the menu.We took a while to decide on our orders and we had to repeatedly request for the servers to assist us on that.Will not deliberately make my way to the restaurant lest i am nearby with a friend who is keen to try something at Bread Street Kitchen.Overall decent food and atmosphere but no wow factor for a Celebrity Chef Restaurant. Would have expected more.Disappointing
4
This is a two-level restaurant inside the Shops at Marina Bay. We were given a counter facing the side walk overlooking Fullerton. I liked the ambience and the view, it was quite relaxing, Since I was in an adventurous mood, I found the English food interesting. Unfortunately, I found the servings size and taste inconsistent. My husband ordered a ham-type dish from the breakfast menu. It was too salty. (Can't recall what the dish was called). My companion also ordered a breakfast dish. Unfortunately, unlike my husband's dish, this serving was quite small though quite tasty. My burger was nice which I shared with my companion
5
Their slow roast pork belly is very tender and soft. Steak is also good! Beef burger is not bad. Their brunch food is not bad. The overall is good! I really love their special coffee mixture with teeling irish. It is so unique taste. Good service
4
Didn't book, came on a Monday night and it was pretty packed so we were offered a seat at the bar tables looking over the Marina Bay. These seats were ready for a couple as there's enough space but you also get to watch people pass in front of you.The food we ordered was great - Fish & Chips and Chicken with a bang bang sauce. Portions were definitely large enough and everything was eaten!Service was friendly and efficient, we were always able to get what we neede
2
For all those complaining about the fish and chips, I had it, and yeah it was probably nothing special (studying in UK means that I eat a lot of fish and chips, and this was decidedly average). But it might not be the best idea to judge a restaurant on pub food. There really isn't all that much creativity that you can inject into this dish (IMO at least).The rather shocking part of the meal, though, was my father's seabass not being fully cooked. That's really not something that should be happening - not even once - at this sort of place. Maybe the kitchen staff need Gordon to come back and whip them into shape. (One wonders how involved the celebrity chefs actually are in these restaurants, halfway across the globe from where they work - our experience at Jamie's Italian at Vivocity was not great either.)That said, to their credit, my mother's pork was excellent (according to her), the desserts were not bad, and the service staff were very efficient and helpful. So there's that.If not for the fish I'd probably have given it a 4. I'd assume (and I really hope) that the fish was a one-off, so I'd probably give them another chance at some point in time
3
This is a famous international restaurant, because the owner is a famous selibritis chef: Gordon Ramsay with his TV show, "Hell's Kitchen", "Kitchen Nightmares" and "Master Chef". But, to taste the food is mediocre, with a fairly expensive price. Of the few foods we ordered, the delicious ones were "Dingley Dell Pork Chop", and "Roasted Sea Trout with Wild Garlic Crust", while "Fish and Chip" was nothing special. The restaurant is always full, and usually has to be a reservation first, probably because many people are curious, and the owner's famous name factor
5
I got up early and had a lovely 2 hour walk around Singapore, so when I arrived for breakfast it was around 8 o'clock. The coffee was not worth having. I am sure their machine has not been cleaned recently.The buttermilk pancakes were amazing as was the detox drink I had.A bit overpriced but worth it after my walk
3
Read some review on the food and service and decided on giving it a try. Food was so-so without any Wow! factor with exception of the dessert. It's cheesecake with ice cream was unique and tasty. The kid's meal pasta with cream sauce for my girl was on the salty spectrum. Service wise, nothing much and just normal. We encounter another place in Singapore that we went yearly which has consistent great service. This place is good for seeing sunset behind the city skyline and maybe seeing people jogging by outside, not for food and service.
4
We visited for brunch and had a great experience. The fresh juices were really good. Our favorite were the pancakes...they were so perfect. We also had the English breakfast which was good except the beans were firm instead of tender (reason for the 4 stars) although the sauce they were in was really good. The coffees were smooth. The chorizo omelette was yummy too.
2
We had dinner here recently & were quite disappointed. They had a problem finding our booking, & lady at the door was rude & unfriendly. We were pleasantly surprised by the gluten free menu on offer as one of our daughters is a celiac, however the food itself was a letdown. I had fish & chips, & the fish was about 2 inches thick & extremely rubbery, & oozing with oil (I would be much happier to get fish & chips from the local takeaway fish shop). Neither of my daughters' meals (kids pasta & a steak) tasted very good, & neither ate much. They took our pram but couldn't find it at the end of the night, & eventually it turned out that it had been dumped out the front. The prices are exorbitant here & it seems to be an average restaurant cashing in on Gordon Ramsey's name... very disappointed & will not be returning
1
Went for brunch. Not hugely busy but seemed rushed, hectic. Open face mushroom omelette was dry, rubbery, tasteless. Chicken Caesar salad was not fresh, chicken was dry as if had been long under warming light. Staff/manager offered to switch out omelette. But this shouldn't happen in the first place.
5
Part of the Gordon Ramsay group I looked forward to this meal for months and we weren't disappointed food was epic served up by the most friendly and efficient staff Set near the entrance of the truly magnificent Tam-pines Shopping mall which is well worth a visit on its own
5
Enjoyed trying out the main dishes served at Breadstreet. Different from other mid-range to high end restaurants in that the food looked and tasted wholesome. Tip: stick to the typically English fare which one would get in the UK itself instead of the tried and tested exports like fish and chips. The authentically English dishes were very good quality
5
Hats off to bar and service staff here who make the dining experience so positive. As with most celebrity restaurants, you can expect to wait a long time for a table. Looking like we fell of the back of a pick up truck after a long journey we probably would have been treated poorly at other establishments but thankfully the good people in Bread Street lived up to the expectations of best service standards. Beers are served in almost-frozen mugs (so good in the stifling Singaporean heat!), Sriracha prawns with mango salad went down like a dream with the ice cold lager! Burgers are served with steak frites and steaks comes with a delectable pepper sauce and vine tomatoes. Quality of meat is excellent, although the burger patty seemed slightly under-seasoned. Portions are good so go hungry

We were looking for a good place to eat on Sunday night and this restaurant was being reviewed on TV. We quickly called and managed to get a reservation later on. Scallops were one of the best I have eaten. It is situated in Marina Bay Sands. Happy we found this place.
2
We arrived without a reservation and were seated with no delay. The atmosphere was very lively (to us, extremely noisy - but not the restaurant's fault though).The disappointment came with the food. My wife asked for a burger, medium, when it came it was raw in the centre - it could almost have been steak tartare - we had to send it back. I ordered a small lobster, it was very small (!) and again it was undercooked.All in all, not a happy dining experience
5
My mom and I visited this restaurant on Father's Day without a reservation. It was my last day in Singapore and I wanted to take my mom to a nice place to eat. The staff were very kind and accommodating although the restaurant was clearly very busy. Thank you
4
My sister-in-law who is from the Philippines loves Gordon Ramsay. It was her dream to eat in one of his restaurants. Hence, when we went to Singapore, we took her to Bread Street Kitchen. The food was great, and they had excellent service. We all enjoyed the food
5
The restaurant was crazy busy so we actually had to be seated outside. We were fine with as there was very little noise. As expected in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the food was amazing, the service was great and the decor was spot on. I'm just sorry we waited until the last night to go there.
3
Had dinner at Bread Street Kitchen in Singapore. Firstly when I rang to book, I was told they were full. We then then went to our lovely concierge at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and all of a sudden there was a table available.The food was just ok. My husband left most of his hamburger. Our friends' medium hamburger was nearly raw. His wife liked her fish and chips. My risotto was ok.The most expensive meal ever. Would not recommend the restaurant to anyone
5
I wouldnt call the food fancy but is just good honest food cooked to perfection. Fish and chips were fantastic, and the blue swimmer crab pasta fantastic also. Great service and in a good location if your sitting up top.
5
Me and my partner went here for Dina after watching Gordon on tv.Food and service were all top notch.Few little extra surprises like bread and cookies before and after which you are not charged for make great little surprise.Prices are fairly high so don't get a shock when you read the menu! and we were told it was fully booked, but turned up to find plenty of spare seatsEnjoy

For our last night in Singapore, my beau and I decided to pay Bread Street a visit as everyday we keep walking pass the Gordon Ramsay sign and we always wonder how his restaurants/the food would be like. We got seated next to window on a rather quiet night, only half of the restaurant was occupied. Cut to the chase: the menu was simple, it was what I would call gourmet gastro-pub English food (having lived in the UK for 7 years, English food never appealed to me as yummy or exotic) but I decided to give the menu a try. We ordered the scallops for starter, slow roasted pork belly with braeburn apple sauce and lamb rump for mains and sticky toffee pudding and chocolate fondant. Let's just say that throughout the whole meal (apart from the scallops - but maybe because scallops is just not our thing) - everytime the dishes come up, we take a bit, we were just in awe in the quality of the meats as well as how well its been cooked. The pork was just delicious - the skin was crispy, the sauce was just the right amount of sweetness not to over compensate the tenderness of the pork belly. The desserts were definitely a nice treat to end the evening with. Definitely a must come! P.S: Prices are not bad either, rather affordable for such a world wide famous chef. Wine list and breads at the beginning are also a great top off

Went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the whole experience. The food was well cooked and tasted great. The service was attentive but never felt intrusive. At no stage did we feel rushed even though there was a queue to get in. Not the cheapest of meals but I don't mind paying for quality food and service.

Beef wellington week...what else can I say? :) Perfectly cooked an it tasted perfect. We had diner at the bar, which had a nice buzz going on. All of the staff were friendly and easy going, especially the hosts.I know it is not the cheapest place around (not the most expensive either) and even Singapore is not cheap in general, I think its okay value for money
4
Two menu stand out: Iberico pork steak + pana cotta for dessert. Ordered the pork chop & it tasted very badl
4
2 course set lunch at $40, 3 course set lunch at $48. Value for money! Delicious and filling. Atmosphere was casual and relaxed. Service was good
4
We had two mains : aged steak and fish and chips set with drink pairing . But the surprise flavor burst was the dessert- coconut sorbet , lime , passion fruit and pineapple carpaccio. And the bread basket was a mix of interesting textures and color. Good enough for a satisfying lunch
5
Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the pork belly and received a generous portion, absolutely delicious. Fries were twice fried and finger licking goo

Had dinner last night had Scallops for starter and a Angus Steak i think the Steak was pre cooked and then heated up for the price i would expect cooked when ordered my wife had the Cod which she said was very nice, cheese and wine . My only complaint is that the Chef in charge decided to discipline a young cook in front of us. I think this is completely out of order and was embarrassing for my wife and i and bad management by Ramsey's management. I am an employer and never discipline an employee in front of customers or other staff. It made the night a bit stressful and for the price i would expect better. The wine list is Ok the wait staff are very good.
5
We visited here yesterday and the lunch was amazing! Brilliant service and food. I ordered the braised steak - would definitely have this again if I return.My partner order eggs benedict and that looked just as good.The bill came to around $100, lovely meal well worth the money.
3
We had a family birthday celebration lunch today. Food was ok and I found nothing particular delightful. The portion was quite big even for sharing. I had chocolate fondant. It is a bit too sweet to me and I much prefer vanilla ice-cream to accompany a chocolate fondant but it was mint chocolate chip ice-cream served.Service was so-so. Maybe everyone was busy. I did have high expectations but am rather disappointed
5
We found this restaurant after an evening visit to gardens at the bay. it was lively with a mix of tourists and young professionals. The menu is fairly short (a Gordon trademark) and is a mix of grills, classics (fish and chips) and some excellent fish fishes. There is a brilliant gin list with a variety of tonics to match - my Cambridge pink gin was fab . The wine list is decent with a good number served by the glass. We hadn't realised how hungry we were till we devoured two baskets of breads ! Breads were all different and I recommend the rosemary and sea salt. Our Starters were scallops- Cooke to perfection with carrot purÃ©e and bacon bits. The cider onion soup is creamy and packed full of taste. This was followed by sea trout served with summer greens and mussels which a wonderful colourful light dish- again with amazing flavours . The cod was a higher piece of fish with crushed potatoes and a full of flavour jus. Service was outstanding , very friendly and wine by glass served expertly - with waiters bringing bottle for you to taste first.A great place for supper and price was reasonable , we will definitely explore the London branch when back home . Nice touch at the end of the meal with staff bringing a cookie jar a perfect sweet ending 
5
The environment, the food and the staff made this a wonderful experience. They really know their stuff. I ate one of the best cod fish dish of my life. The price tag is a bit high for this type of restaurant but for me it was worth it. There were also small little details that make all the difference. The speed of the service, the staff was so nice but with a lot of attention to details, our table was always organized, and all of what was served was simply amazing. I will return.
4
Service was very attentive and prompt. We ate as a group of 6 and paid almost $70 per pax. The place got crowded with the Marina Bay Financial area lunch crowd rather quickly and volume can get quite loud... The restaurant was nicely decorated and the spacing between tables afforded some privacy amidst the constant buzz. The set lunch menu was great and the recommended dishes will be the burger and the meat sharing platter, fish and chips. Pass on the pasta, the mushroom pappardelle was very disappointing for an ala carte main. Overall a great experience and would go back again for the meat platte
4
Its over-rated as felt its not as great with the price tag. Its a casual restuarant with some service and sub-standard food. Will not try again

Popped into Bread street this morning for an impromptu breakfast. We ordered the poached eggs with avocado on pumpernickel and the scrambled eggs with chorizo and Chilli. Firstly my poached eggs came out on burnt toast. I mentioned this to our server who then asked me what I'd like done about it? No "sorry I'll change it for you." I had to suggest it be redone. It came back out swiftly but decidedly lacking much flavour and seasoning. My husband's eggs were also fairly tasteless but we were super surprised that the only bread of choice was anaemic white sliced or brown-no sour dough or even a seeded granary. My Husband also ordered a juice and we were surprised it was out of a bottle and not fresh. Never eaten here before but considering the Ramsay name behind it and the price; it was a massive disappointment. We mentioned our comments to our sever but it fell on death ears and responded with an insincerity that seemed very rude.Another celebrity Chef sells out!

I came here the first time ordering scallops for my starters with slowly roasted pork belly and it was great. However, the second time I was greatly disappointed by the quality of the service other reviews is complimenting the service.. I don't know if the servers thought of me less important because I was alone but it was hard for me to get the attention of the servers. I had to ask for the water every time and I had to ask to change my utensils when the food changes. I believe, these are some simple things that a customer would be looking out for if they are paying around 70dollars, which I did since I paid for two mains. Oh and the most irritating part was that I couldn't even get a fine "thank you" even though I paid and was literally 2steps away from the door so instead I chose to thank them and at that time I was able to hear a "goodbye".. bloody hell Gordon should have taught you guys better.... Anyways, I believe Gordon taught the chef really well since the food was excellent both times
3
Myself and my work colleague stopped here for an early evening meal after visiting the bay. We both had the burger which although was good failed to live up to the burger I had a few days earlier in the Little island brewing company in Changi.The service was very good and attentive. Rather expensive relative to the other burger I had
4
The food is generally quite nice but it's pretty pricey. The service is just average and I have to say the place is nicely decorated.
5
Everything in this restaurant is fantastic ranging from location, view, service, food quality and quantity. It lives up to the expectation as how Gordon Ramsay does. I will definitely be back to dine in again. Cheers
3
Decent food but nothing to rave about. The steak was nicely cooked but portions were on the small side. We ordered the mixed grill platter which was pretty pricey at $130 considering the small portions. Onion rings were nicely done though. Serv

Came across this restaurant whilst shopping at Marina Bay. What a pleasant surprise. Great service and very friendly helpful staff. Food was amazing, had the Baked Ocean Trout. Really tender, cooked to perfection and served with asparagus and mussels. Great combo. Very happy. Well worth the visit. Well priced for the quality of dining given
5
I love everything that we ordered, from the starter to the main course. I was too full to order dessert and that is become a reason so I can come back again. very satisfied. The staff is very friendly, good ambiance and service. Very high recommended and it a must visit place.
1
The food quality and cooking was terrible. Couldn't be more disappointed. We had a table of five, so a wide range of starters and mains, and they were all terrible. Given Gordon Ramsey's name is on the door, I expected much more. What a shame
5
Perfect brunch and ambience for a laid back sunday. Food is as good as any Chef Ramsay's place! Staffs-very professional. Highly recommended!
4
Been here a few times, good simple food, nice staff, easy to get seat at bar usually. not too price
5
Love the fish & chips and purÃ©e. Conveniently located at one of Singapore's 2 casino venues Marina Bay Sands. Accessibility is not a problem by public transport. Staffs are friendly and attentive.
5
This is the fourth of Gordon Ramsay restaurants that we have visited and the first in the "East". Lovely food, reasonably priced for Singapore and a good selection of fine drinks to accompany. All the staff were every friendly and the top deck view over the marina was very nice even during the thunderstorm that we were having while eating.

My husband and I visited Bread Street for lunch, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We had to wait 45mins for a table, which we saw as a good sign as the restaurant was at full capacity. The staff member on front desk took our number in case anything became available earlier. We went for a walk and came back to be seated promptly.I am gluten intolerant and they had a special GF menu available, which I was very grateful for as GF options have been something that has been very hard to find while in Singapore.They served us up with complimentary bread when we sat down, and the initial service was very prompt. The waiter took note that I was dinning GF and arranged GF bread without me having to ask.The food came promptly, we ordered entrees and mains. We both had a crab dish, mine with salad and my husbands with pasta and both delicious. The mains were substantial, and very good. My husband had the pork belly which came with a delicious apple sauce. I had the duck which was nice, a tad dry but nice all the same. Both came with a jus in a separate pourer specialised for the dish which I thought was a nice touch.We finished with tea, coffee and biscuits.The service seemed to wain a little towards the end of our meal, which could be put down to an end of shift maybe as we had a later lunch.Very happy with our choice of restaurants
4
Had good service by staff although they were kind of business. Table at Kitchen Concept floor was comfy but we prefer the street view where we can see more people and action. This floor we were like the fish on display as people were peering into the glass panels to check the place out. Food was ok for me cos the pork chop was huge and thick. Other family members had their choices and they loved it
5
Great tasty Gluten free lunch. Good service. A separate menu with GF options. Really enjoyed the lunch.
5
Visited Bread Street Kitchen at Marina Bay Sands last Sunday for brunch. There were five of us. Besides items on their brunch menu, like The English Breakfast and Eggs Benedict, we also tried their mains and salads. All were excellent! Especially the Eggs Benedict! The restaurant occupies two levels, L1 and B1, so it better to check with them when making reservations. L1 is facing Marina Bay so you can soak in the fantastic view of Singapore's city skyline while you dine. B1 is more cozy and we enjoyed the ambiance and personalized service when we were there.Price wise it was definitely value for money as you can't find another place in Singapore that gives you Michelin like food, service and ambiance at such relatively affordable prices. Highly recommended

Booked online for a 9:15 PM sitting, easy option...Bit rowdy when we first went in with some one REALY enjoying themselves at the bar but not offensive just loud no problems there although we was out for a romantic meal. Gotta say the 1st burger we had was that raw if it was in the UK it would have 'qualified for disability benefit.. ' after ordering a medium to well done we got a raw burger.. me I'd of loved it but Mrs wasn't too keen on it "mooing and bleeding on her plate" but to be fare a quiet word and it was changed.. was offered my meal to be kept warm..but never taken up as I felt it may have spoiled..very quickly rectified..then to the bar after, four cocktails paid for 6... not to happy with the cost Mrs went back in to politely question.. staff VERY FRIENDLY knew they had over charged got the duty manager in to look realised we was over charged AND had the raw burger earlier and 'sorted us out' due to not having the best of nights they would of liked us to have had..so more then happy with the service from everyone in there and the decision made by the manager (anyone can make mistakes) but overall more then happy with the place and defiantly return.. thanks for a great night and after a word looking after us much appreciated.. would say Ramsey kitchen nightmares, sorted by Ramsey's helpful staf

We have been to the Bread Street Kitchen a few times over the recent years. It's always been a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. Marina Bay is ofcourse a nice location. Brunch is always busy so book a few days ahead. Ask for a table on the upper floor which is at the level of the Bay, with a water view. Interesting cocktails.They seem to love Monkey Shoulder Whisky. The Gin cocktails are nice for brunch. Food is great with interesting variety. The Angus steak is a good choice. Had medium done which was still quite juicy and with great taste. Quite a satisfying portion. Quinoa salad is lovely. The grilled Prawns are slightly disappointing. Avoid!!The Sunday brunch menu is not as extensive as some other restaurants in Singapore but it is different to most. He sticky Toffee pudding is divine. The Price is pretty reasonable. Anything between 80-100 per person. If driving, park at the South wing of the car park for easy access. On the whole a nice experience and great for special occasions. But not a tourist venue I don't think. More an expat kind of place!!!

Interesting bread basket, good fish'n chips with mushy peas. Excellent water front location, noisy ambience.
4
Of course... it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, so that alone made us want to try this place. We came here for brunch with friends and I was honestly disappointed. Two of us got the eggs benedict, I've had many eggs benedict in my life... never have I just had these 2 tiny eggs placed on the ham and topped with the sauce, and NOTHING else on the plate, not even bread! The food is fine, but the portions are super small for what you are paying (just cause its 'Gordon Ramsay's restaurant'...). I find it a bit steep
5
Had the set menu lunch which was 2 courses for S$40 - so considering the location and association with Gordon Ramsey, this was good value and the food was excellent
5
The only Gordon Ramsay restaurant in South East Asia! Fantastic décor, a very welcoming restaurant features a simple but comprehensive menu that showcases a mix of traditional and modern British favourites. Food: The slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly is a must try, cooked perfectly maintaining the tenderness, succulent meat with the right amount of lean and fats. Complimented with spiced apple puree. The risotto was also nicely done. However, the roasted duck breast was slightly below expectation, especially the taste but it could be from an Asian point of view. The complimentary cookies at the end was also a star. Value: Reasonable for the environment and quality Environment: Nice and unique décor Service: Very good service and fast. Comes with special gift for young children to keep them occupied while waiting for our meal!Tips: Very crowded, be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment

The first visit to BSK was on my birthday last year and I had thoroughly enjoyed my dinner with the impeccable service and good food. This time, I went with the family for a more casual dining experience. Reservation is highly recommended as the restaurant was running full even on a weekday night. There is a kids' menu and each child received a colouring kit from the friendly staff. As we were a group of 7, we decided to order a variety of dishes and share the portions (soups, salads, fish, burger, pasta, seafood, dessert). Portions were just nice. There was enough for all of us.As usual, the staff were excellent - friendly and courteous, they made the effort to engage the children and even offered cookies at the end of the meal. An enjoyable evening for all.
5
Located inside Marina Bay Sand shopping mall. In short: great food, great service, great atmosphere
3
I went to this restaurant with a friend. Food is overrated. We took Chicken wings. They were fine but were a challenge to eat with fork and knife. I also ate the Sea Trout. Whereas the trout was good, fresh and very well done the couscous served along was bland and did not go well with the trout at all. The staff is courteous and that is the highlight of this restaurant
5
Always scouting places to eat, but this was a first from Gordon Ramsey. Actualy a lot of simple dishes, but with great products and quality. Most certainly a place worth visiting
5
Had a great meal- very balanced on spices for mild tingle across senses... well done and worth recommending 
4
Bread street has a good gluten free menu with great tasting food. Drinks a bit higher priced than others but good food
4
We went there to grab a lunch twice in two days. And it was our first time at Gordon Ramsays.Staff is friendly and professional. We ate just main course, but it was delicious twice. We chose chicken, duck breast, mashed potatoes and spiced carrots. All delicious. They also have a great selection of wines. I am gluten free so I found it very nice they offered me a gluten free menu. The only thing I don't understand in restaurants like this is they offer just this really tasteless gluten free toast. I know there are other very good ways to offer a gluten free person great alternative, so it would be nice to think about that for the future. Otherwise all good and would recommend it!
5
Had the pork belly which was succulent and tender. Crackling was a crispy although a little bit hard. Their breads were great with the salted butter. A friend had the burger which I tried which was excellent. All in all, good food with great ambiance if you like modern industrial decor
4
This restaurant offers a very affordable lunch menu available 11-4. We were very surprised to be able to afford to eat in Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. 3 fabulous courses for $48. Service was impeccable. Plenty of fresh bread on offer, free of charge. One of our friends was a celiac and was very satisfied. Only catch was we were charged $9 each for bottled water and we had three. If we'd simply asked for table water it would have been free. Live and learn. Overall a wonderful experience. Absolutely delicious food, beautiful views and attentive staff.
4
A self-guided walking tour through the Gardens by the Bay and then the Marina Bay Sands area is a great day out in Singapore. We lost track of time and at 8pm chose to go to the Bread Street Kitchen as we found ourselves standing outside their front door. Were were seated immediately and the good service continued for the rest of the evening. We had a selection of appetizers, meat and fish and it became clear that whatever you choose is going to be well prepared. The wine list was excellent and I haven't even mentioned dessert. All of us would happily return
5
As you would expect Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street does not disappoint! We went there for lunch and chose the 3 course set menu for $48 which consisted of entree main and sweets. For entree we had the cured salmon and avacado and the Quinoa salad both were very tasty. For mains we had grilled Iberico pork steak and the fettuccine again both nicely cooked. For sweets we had the cheese plate and the vanilla tonka bean panna cota again dry tasty. Only issue for Australians will be the shock at the cost of wines. There were bottles on the menu that we would buy in a bottle shop for $18 selling on the menu for in excess of $100!! Wine by the glass was slightly more reasonable. They also serve water so don't let the wine prices put you off as the food is great
3
Chicken wings and lamb shank amazing. Short rib burger not very nice at all and even found a hair in it!!!!!!. We are massive fans of Ramsay and would have thought there'd be no way you could mess up a burger. They didn't have a regular size sparkling water and charged us $9 for it (would have thought water would be complimentary). Staff were very nice and the kitchen is hidden which makes the experience very nice, just sucks about the burger.
2
Knowing this would be very busy, we pre-booked our table for Sunday lunch time. We were seated downstairs on a large communal table,(there was 7 offs, 4 adults, 3 kids) that had another party seated at the other end. Whilst we waited for our friends to arrive (with their two small children needing high chairs, which we'd asked for) another family arrived, (walk ins) and were seated between us and the other party at the end. There was now no room for the children! We complained to one of the staff, who said she'll bring more chairs. But that meant we'd be really squashed. So we complained again..we had booked after all and they shouldn't of given the space to the walk ins. Eventually another member of staff moved us to our own table upstairs. But this took time, and with three hungry stroppy kids and husbands it wasn't much fun! As a way of apology they gave the adults a glass of sparkling wine..ok a nice gesture..but nothing for the children.We ordered fish and chips for the children...which was very small and came first. I also ordered fish and chips, the others ordered the Sunday lunch and pork belly. The Sunday lunch was cold..so my husband sent his back,(the other guest was too hungry so ate his cold). It was returned re cooked after the rest of us had finished. My fish and chips was ok..the chips were just like large oven chips you can buy in the supermarket and the fish was very bland. Not worth the money at all! My friend enjoyed her pork belly but wished it came with more. That's the problem with this type of restaurant. You pay quite a lot for your main, but then if you want potatoes/fries/veggies etc you have to pay extra. And the quality of the food just isn't worth it. My desert of the apple and blackberry crumble was nice, but the little bit of custard I got was cold..so that was sent back. All in all we won't go back again..it seems it just doesn't cope very well when its busy, (place was packed with families) despite the huge amount of staff
5
We came here for my daughter's birthday dinner whilst on holiday. We tried to book online but they were fully booked, but I emailed on the off chance they could fit us in. The response was quick and they offered us a table in the downstairs dining area (which we actually preferred). The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and the service is genuine and courteous. Now to the food - best fish and chips ever! So, so good. The pork belly was divine especially with all that crackling. The burger was a decent burger but my son wished he had ordered something else with a little more wow. The bread provided is soft and delicious and you just need to slather it in the butter. We had a couple of cocktails and the wait staff sang Happy Birthday to my daughter and presented her with a chocolate brownie. This was also delicious. Loved this place and whilst it isn't cheap ($200) it was absolutely worth every cent. Thank you for one of my most memorable meals ever.
2
The only reason we went to this restaurant was the Gordon Ramsey factor - this in itself set high expectations. Sadly they did not deliver on any level. We were there early - 5.30pm for an evening meal and the service was slack, the burgers were cold and had no wow factor and the chips were dry and cold. A glass of wine was $22 Singapore dollars plus 17% tax plus another 10% service charge. There must be plenty of better restaurants to try before this one. Gordon Ramsey - suggest you go and check your own restaurant out
5
We stayed at marina bay sands and went to bread street kitchen for breakfast twice and lunch once during our stay. We found the service to be excellent, Carlo in particular looked after us each time we came here. The lunch we had downstairs and kids enjoyed their meals, pencil sets and we had beautiful pasta, sashimi and cocktails! We found this to be the only place in marina bay with a kids menu. Breakfast they do a la carte versus the buffet options at every hotel option which suited us best. Recommend visiting this place with upstairs and downstairs!

My daughter and I went to Singapore for the Rugby 7's and decided to have a treat for dinner Friday night. We didn't book but after a 20 minute wait they managed to find a table for us as we were only 2. Why is it so good?The staff are excellent very well trained know the menu very well and are able to make recommendations that turned out to be excellent. As you would expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant the food was top notch. Waiters/waitresses were so attentive and the setting is excellent. It was an experience my daughter won't forget thanks to the team for making the whole experience so wonderful. Not my first time here and last time it was great this time it was excellent they have improved and that is hard when you start from a high poin
4
We ordered Pork Belly, Lamb Shank and the Burger. Every dish was fantastic, but the pork belly was the most impressionable! You have to try it
4
This is my second time here and the food was great. However it gets very hot in there as they have a large opening along the bar tables and the hot Singapore air comes in. It gets a little uncomfortable while eating. The service is great and they fit us in without hesitation
4
We are local residents and finally had a chance to drop by this shop. First of all, the service was excellent. We sat at the bar with narrow tables facing Marina Bay and the wait staff were constantly checking on us and making sure we had all we needed. We ordered the Shepard's Pie which was promoted as a fan favorite. This was the only area that was disappointing, It was more like Shepard's Pie Soup with a baked bread top...but regardless we were still satisfied and even had desert (Warm Chocolate Fondant Cake) which really made the evening! Overall experience was very good
4
The atmosphere is enjoyable in the restaurant. The choice is enough and can satisfied any one , meat , fish etc With some good specialities like the king crab
5
Restaurant celebrity chef gordan Ramsay ..open in shops at marina Bay sands ..last Year ..heard about very good things about this Restaurant ,,Better then london we went for family dinner ..the warm welcome of service and food was amazing ,,each course are presenting very well ,,,we will definitely come back soon missing beer batter fried fish ..and yummy slide
5
Having had a very bad experience in a Gordon Ramsey flagship restaurant in London (the grill) I was apprehensive about here. My wife wished to try it for a birthday treat and we went along with 7 friends.What a very very pleasant surprise .. reservations were helpful and efficient including ordering a cake and accommodating my request to be on upper level.The service .. the staff .. the sommelier and duty manager were all friendly efficient and wonderfully attentive to the table all evening. We were not rushed and had a superb meal.Scallops lamb shank tenderloin and the pasta dishes were all highly rated ... tasty and very good. One pasta dish was too salty for a guest and was immediately replaced... without complaints.We all had a great evening .. good company and the bday cake which was a monkey shoulder cheesecake was divine. I will definitely return .... well done too all.Great wine list ... whiskey choice could be better ... but overall good.Not cheap ... but not expensive either
4
Sought out BSK as a treat for lunch and change from hawker markets etc. We arrived a bit after 12 so were able to get a table easily though later it was quite full.I found the prices reasonable - we had fish and chips and the set lunch with 2 courses. Meals were delicious - fish and chips were very hot and some of the best I've eaten ( and there have been a few). Cured salmon was very delicate, pasta also tasty. Bread bowl was unexpected - the whole meal seeded roll the best - and the cookies with the bill a nice touch.Our two wait staff were very friendly and efficient when they dealt with us. But I would say that generally the service was indifferent - staff were standing around chatting, and it was difficult to get someone's attention for the bill.Would recommend a visit if looking for a change from Asian food at reasonable price
5
Wonderful Brunch!The eggs Benedict at BSK are always a weekend highlight and this weekend there were 3 additions for Easter. I had salmon, Avacado and my husband had the sausage and hashbrown version. Both very decadent and delicious. We didn't realize how large the specials were and ordered my favorite scallops for an appetizer. Make sure you have reservations or it could be a long wait. Hope that was helpful?Diane and Pete in Singapore.
5
Interestingly the food were really nice. We ordered the Set Lunch menu and we selected:Entree: Smoked Duck & Pork Terrine, Apple Chutney, Sourdough - the apple chutney really gave flavour to the duck. Duck and pork terrine was very tender and juicy. Main: Braised Ox Cheek, Mashed Potato, Spiced Carrots - excellent juicy tender meat. Gravy mixed well with the potato and meat. Wonderful!Dessert: Baileys Creme Brulee, Shortbread - it was ok but not as expected. It was a bit eggy although you can still taste a bit of baileys. On top of the set lunch, we also ordered the Slow Roasted Pork Belly. It was really awesome. Pork skin was crispy and the sauce (apple puree) was well balanced. Meat was juicy too.Overall, we had a really great experience at BSK. Price for the 3 course set lunch was SGD$48 and the Pork Belly was SGD$28
5
I heard a lot about this place from my friends..so I decided to book a table for my overseas friends ..we had bottle of wine a beer and the cocktail with lemoncello...it was really very nice cocktail after the food ..I order a rissotto n my friends ordered some salad n salmon fish ..all foods are very good ..this is he best rissotto I ever try ..the deserts were also good ..it's really thoughtful when they give us some cookies after the food ..the service was really nice ..we choose to book a late lunch ..that time it was not busy ..so we had a beautiful time ..overall it was a good experience..I will recommend to my friends this restaurant.

Bread Street Kitchen Singapore Well what can I say about this restaurant ( Hell kitchen food experience ) it was dreadful ,the only good part of the restaurant would be the Ambience ,its lovely , dark yet stylish with a nice view of the skyline. But the food is tasteless and service is inactive. Staff seems that they attending a funeral, No one smiled, and no one said thanks for coming we felt invulnerable throughout. To sum up in few words, my dining experience at BSK ranks one of the worst dining experience in Singapore .Most of the food we ordered was absolutely tasteless, you'd expect way better food when the restaurant bears the name of such a famous celebrity chef (Gordon Ramsey) the place was a big letdown. Honestly to me, Hawker Centre food tastes much better. This place is expensive and poor value for money definitely overpriced! I should have known better the place is mainly for tourists. WITHOUT A SHRED OF DOUBT WILL NOT RETURN
4
Pretty good, as you'd expect. Customer service perhaps slightly more patchy than we're used to in U.K. GR restaurants, but on the whole, no problems. My only issue was with the size of the main courses, which were smaller than I hoped. My lamb shank was cooked well and tasty, but the meat was gone in a flash....
5
I have got to say this restaurant checks all the right boxes! Amazing ViewFriendly StaffGreat MenuSuper foodDid I forget to say this is run by Gordon Ramsay
4
The BSK is situated amongst many award winning restaurants and call MBS home. Consisting of two stories, the higher floor offers more scenic view of the harbor. Blackened cod and lamb chops were really good as dishes are earthy w a distinct Gordon Ramsey signature. Dessert was a sticky pudding topped w banana toffee sauce with a tad of clotted cream. Decadent indeed. A winner certainly !

Over-all dining experience was most enjoyable. I didn't have a reservation in advance just walked-in and was accommodated right away. The staff was friendly, made sure I had my order delivered shortly. The bartender explained the cocktails selection and definitely enjoyed the food

6 April 2017 ThursdayHad the set lunches and the Tamarind Chicken Wings as an extra.The dishes were simple, portions were perfect. Bread basket with 5-6 different types of bread was refillable but one basket was more than enough.Wait staff were very attentive and the entire lunch went by in a very unhurried manner.Restaurant was full so do make reservations in advance.

After a warm welcome I ordered a large cesar salad as main course because I was not that much hungry. Sitting right in front of the open kitchen it was possible to observe the cooks dressing the salad. It took just about 5 to 10 minutes having the meal on the table.I unfortunately habe to say that I had never such a terrible cesar salad like at this restaurant - and I had a lot of cesar salads in my life. Size was okay. Egg, bacon and parmesan also. The dressing was the problem. Yes, a cesar dressing could me made with anchovy and also anchovy on the top but the whole salad taste very much just like anchovy. The anchovy should just give the dressing a spicy and salty taste without tasting like fish. The whole dressing and so the salad had a very flat and not spicy taste and I thought about just licking on a whole fish coming right out the ocean.Very disappointing and too expensive for this result

After a big day out, we savoured our time at Bread Street. Staff were great, bread and the salted butter was delicious, entrees tasty and our main (fish and chips) wonderful. The gin and tonic menu was a highlight. Servings weren't huge and didn't need to be. We had to roll out the door, being so full.Highly recommend this restaurant for couples, families and friends - it covered all the bases
4
We had an early dinner here where the staff was a little pushy about timing, but the meal was amazing. Started with some tar tare and more than normal amounts of bread (hey were on vacation!) then ordered a 500ML gas pump full of Gin and Tonic - which was awesome, such a clever concept. We had salmon and the aged steak for our mains which were fantastic. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes that pair perfectly with the steak (hence me taking pieces of steak and slaloming them down what I dubbed "Mashed Potato Mountain") My girlfriend looked on in disgust. It was AWESOME. Excellent food and my second time here. Highly recommend it albeit the high price - but hey you're in Singapore. Everything is expensive!! Enjoy!

On arrival the staff made my brother and I feel welcome but once seated the experience changed. Our waiter was a Russian or Eastern European lady. She seemed too good to take an order or even work in the restaurant to be honest.When we stated that we only wanted main courses she turned her nose up as if to say we were cheapskates.I had a glass of wine and ordered from the rare cuts steak menu. The fillet steak was fantastic and the wine was delicious.Getting a member of staff to bring us a bill was hassle too, however it was a nice touch when they bring you cookies with the bill.The actual food in BSK was fantastic but the atmosphere is poor. It's not a fine dining restaurant but it's also not McDonalds, I think the staff should look after the customer a little better

Came for a birthday celebration as a party of eight for dinner. Many individual orders of starters, mains and dessert and I will just mention a few. First, the outstanding starters - chicken liver and foie gras parfait ($23), seared scallops ($24) and the tomato tart ($20). The chicken liver/foie gras parfait was a generous helping that came with Earl Grey jelly and toasted brioche - smooth, rich and decadent. After polishing off the brioche, we used the complimentary bread to mop up the remainder. The scallops (just 3) were juicy and perfectly paired with salty bacon bits and tangy apple and celery cress. The tomato tart came topped with caramelised onions and burrata cheese but it was the balsamic glaze that lifted the tart to a different dimension. Of the mains, the Dingley Dell pork chops ($44) was the best - juicy with the right amount of fat. The much-hyped fish and chips ($29) was a bit of a disappointment and it is because we prefer thin fillets with "more" batter than fish! The fish fillets were nicely done (3 of us had it) but we felt that the "fish to batter ratio" was too much. The chips were good and generously salted (yums!). The lovely dessert was the pineapple carpaccio with passion fruit, coconut sorbet and lime ($15) - a deliciously refreshing and light finish to a heavy meal. Service was attentive and the staff well informed. Portions were big and we had to doggie bag some of the mains
2
I ordered medium air-aged Rib Eye steak. The taste was rather bland, not juicy and the fat lining was so unchewable that I had to cut it out. My spouse got grilled baby chicken, which was OK, but nothing more than that - just a plain grilled chicken with spicy sauce. Quinoa salad was good but again nothing special. Considering the 180 SGD bill, we were highly disappointed
5
I have read a lot of up and down reviews of this place but I still decided to give it a try. Apart from the haughty hostess asking me if I had a reservation when the place was half empty, the staff were friendly and attentive, I ordered a Tennent's Whisky Oak beer which arrived promptly, ice cold and with a frosty glass. The bread basket arrived in a flash and the selection was hot and served with a generous slab of butter. I decided to go for the fish and chips which arrived in double quick time with a friendly smile from the waitress.The fish was piping hot, crispy light batter and the fish was flaky and delicious. Unlike in Dubai I found the crushed peas quite tasty and the chips crispy and fresh.I left the BSK in Dubai feeling a bit let down but this visit in Singapore was a pleasant experience
4
I came here for breakfast with my 4yo daughter. We shared the English Breakfast and were not disappointed. She particularly loved the sausages and bacon. Although she didn't eat the baked beans. This surprised me as they were the reason she wanted to order the English Breakfast in the first place. I think she was confused because they didn't look like tinned baked beans. That's a good thing btw. My only issue (and why it doesn't get five stars) was the bread. I expected much better bread (certainly better than what I can buy from the supermarket) from a place called Bread Street
5
Iâ€™ve been to Bread Street Kitchen about 6 or 7 times. It is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. The ambience is brilliant, the service is very good and the food is how it should be, tasty and the right sized portion. You might not like everything on the menu, but there should be something for everyone.The Sunday Roast is really good with a decent sized portion of tasty well cooked beef, fantastic Yorkshire Pudding, nice veggies, good horseradish sauce and an excellent gravy. Please bring back the draft cider
4
Came her for a first time with my friend. Must commend that the service attention level was good. We had kelvin, who was so patient in explaining to us the manythinga we want to eat! But there is only two of us.. well i settled for the scallops as starter, the house speciality fish & chips, my friend went for the foie gras as her starter and cod fish as main. I love the scallops,well done. The sauce that came with it complimented the roasted scallops. Fish and chips was good but fantastic. Had a peppery taste which made it different from others out there. My friend commented her foie gras was good and the cod which she aske for with mash potato( instead of smash) went well.we were offered extra breadroll and butter as my friend loved salty butter. She could not stop raving about it! It was a pack day . Mix of both locals and tourists. Overall a pleasant visi
3
The place was nice,cozy and the staff were friendly and welcoming.They were patient enough to let us decide what to order and they always asked and checked on us if we had any provlems.The food's presentation was astonishing and appetizing but the taste was dissapointing as the steak was bland and I ordered the sea trout but they served me a seared salmon with bland couscous.I hope this can chang
4
We descended on the Bread Street Kitchen purely by chance and tried to get a table for two without having booked in advance. This didn't seem to be a major problem as we were directed to a table outside by two large ventilator fans. A waiter was immediately on hand to take our drinks order.Soon afterwards another friendly and chatty waiter turned up to take our order for our evening meal. After the best part of three weeks eating lovely Asian food I decided that it was time for a fish and chips supper - complete with mushy peas and malt vinegar. This was delicious and went down a treat.As we were placed in a rather quiet and hidden corner outside we didn't get much of an impression of the rest of this establishment. In fact, only when leaving did we discover that this belongs to Gordon Ramsey.Not bad, if rather pricey..
3
My family plan a Birthday Brunch at The Bread Street Kitchen in MBS. I would say that the food is below my expectations and the team could have done better. The food we order was overly salted and the bread is served cold and felt stale as the name "Bread Street Kitchen" you expect a decent bread to be at least be served warm. The Highlight of our brunch was the pan cakes, soft and so so fluffy my kids enjoyed them. The saving grace was from the Dessert section... Chef Jean if I'm not wrong was the one prepared the dessert that day and the banana toffee pudding, the peanut chocolate cake, pineapple passionfruit coconut dessert is to die for... and definitely a must try on my list
5
Dinner was really good and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend the grill menu for meat lovers ! For me, I had the cod fish and it was really tender.Desserts are also delicious Nice sport in Singapore
4
This causal dining establishment by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay is worth a visit to try his signature dishes, and soak in the lively atmosphere of the bustling restaurant with a friendly crew from mixed nationalities
3
This is the second visit to Bread St Kitchen and we were disappointed this time.My cod was cold and needed to be returned. The lamb was also tepid but my partner ate it anyway. Carrots had a scented taste which ruined them.Stewardess on level 2 really couldn't have cared if we had dined there or not... the whole thing was very rushed ... 2 courses and coffee within 1.5 hours and of course - expensive. Sadly there are better places in MBS to ea

Went here with the wife for lunch during a visit to Singapore. Very pleasant and helpful staff. We had items off the menu rather than the set lunch. The food was good, exactly as described and delivered with all the right condiments (except for salt which it really needed). The delivery looked excellent and the plates were a nice touch. And yet... it really was nothing to write home about. Both dishes looked great and tasted OK, and I suppose I found that disappointing. We didn't go there for 'OK'. It was efficient, competent food but which really lacked any character which was a shame because it was a lovely table, attentive staff and an overall pleasant experience. But I doubt I would go there again, simply because I would rather try the far better tasting food elsewhere - and I don't mean different types of food. I have had the same dishes elsewhere and I have wanted to lick the plate! Not this time
5
The food is incredible - MUST TRY risotto. The staff is fantastic and the views from the dining area and bar are beautiful
5
I went to this restaurant with very high expectations because I know it belongs to Gordon Ramsay. Gladly it met with those. Loved the ambience and staff, and of course the food. The interiors reflect Ramsay's personality in a way. It's a little pricey, but we're paying for the brand. The presentation was good, the quantity can improve. Overall, I'm glad I went there
5
One area of the restaurant has a nice outdoor view. Enjoyed looking at the evening urban dwellers jog by. This area of the restaurant always has an enthusiastic waiter serving the customers seated on this long wooden table. Love the chicken dish the most
4
I went here for my 26th Birthday Celebrations. Me and my parents tried this restaurant for the first time. We ordered sooo much because the staff has recommend a lot of good stuff from Gordon's recipe. After three days, I was still feeling full from the good food. No kidding! I wish they are open at Jakarta tho - I will definately go there. If you have a Citibank card, you can get extra discount! I was so excited by my experiences eating at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and accidentally ordered a free flow alcohol drink - thinking it was some kind of mocktail - didn't realize that was alcohol and I'm allergic to alcohol. I informed the staff that I'm allergic and he immediately gave me a free non alcoholic drink. I know Gordon's restaurant is one of the best because he always trained his staff everywhere in the world to maintain his top quality. and yes, you should definitely try their fish and chips. It's da bomb
3
This is our fourth visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. It's nice to say we've tried GR restaurants, but there is nothing too special about this one. The food is probably intentionally very plain and simple, therefore it appears expensive for what your getting other than paying for the GR name.We had the feeling that the staff were not best organised. We had reason to complain about an undercooked chicken starter, which at first we thought hadn't been taken into proper consideration by our waiter. We did subsequently receive an apology from a senior member of staff when receiving our bill and the offending starter had been removed.The location is quite decent with a view out to Marina Bay Area. Unless you really want to dine at a GR restaurant, our suggestion is to dine somewhere else in Singapore
4
You simply just can't avoid the major carb overload with the free flow bread baskets that comes with really sinfully tasty butter! A must have is definately the fish and chips, along with the chicken wings
5
There is a lot of mixed reviews regarding the food and service but I still give it a try.The restaurant is easy to locate. They served complimentary bread. I ordered asparagus with quail egg in hollandaise sauce as appetizer and it was really good. For main I have ordered Fish and Chips served with green pea mash and a beef burger.The hand cut chips is crunchy and not oily but the fish is normal. The staff service was excellent! They are very attentive and helpful. They pay attention to customer and that was really warm. Beef burger was cooked just nice. Tender and juicy but can be more flavourful. Environment is a bit noisy for me. A bit pricey but it worth it. Had a pleasant experiece! Not forgetting the dessert, I have ordered a blueberry ice cream wit h cheesecake. The ice cream is made of fresh blueberry and the cheesecake was creamy. Simply love it
4
I had brunch here with a friend yesterday. I had ordered a cider-onion soup and the chicken liver and foie gras parfait while she ordered the same soup and a pork pie. The soup was tasty but creamier than we expected. We had both expected the more consommé style soup though to be fair, it wasn't French onion soup on the menu. My parfait was good and my friend enjoyed her pie too. Do make a reservation as the place was full. The service was exceptional.
3
We dined on a late lunch time slot and actually missed our reservation, but reception still accommodated us with a smile. Staff is superb -- attentive and efficient. We ordered the red cabbage salad, fish & chips, and pork chop. I must say i like the salad the best. I can't help but feel slightly disappointed as i was expecting to be overwhelmingly wowed given Gordon Ramsey's reputation. Nice to try, but not something i would be craving for to make me go back
4
Key point - allow at least 15 minutes between the time you plan to get to Marina Bay Sands and the time of your reservation at Bread Street Kitchen. MBS is an enormous mall and casino complex that doesn't have great signposting or mapping inside it.Once you've found the restaurant, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It spreads over two or three floors and is usually busy with all the atmosphere that goes with lots of folk enjoying themselves in a setting with mostly hard surfaces and few soft furnishings.The menu contains a mix of local and imported produce and dishes with a firm, but by no means overpowering English influence. Maybe I've led a sheltered life, but to turn over an impressive gin list to find an equally impressive tonic list on the back was a new, and very welcome, experience for me!Quality of the food and service is very high. It's said that Gordon Ramsey keeps a close eye on things via regular visits. The wine list is cosmopolitan and food and drink prices are at the low end of the fine dining spectrum
4
Nice view, fast service, they even accomodated us even if we are late fron our reservation. I like the lady in the conceirge, she look strict but professional. And ensure we have a seat quickly.
4
I was skeptical about going to this restaurant but felt inviting to give it a try. As all restaurants in Singapore are expensive, I will not say too much about the cost or value. Food was fairly good as I had the pork belly entrée. I was told the fish and chips was "some of the best encountered". I had a sample of the sea bass and not particularly impress. Staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. Might come back but so many other choices in SGP
5
Perfectly located inside the Marina Bay Mall. The atmosphere and the staff were great! The steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Enjoyed the whole experience
3
Slow service, poor timing of meals at table of 8. Some had finished main before otrhers had entree.Average atmosphere (poor lighting and acoustics) and food.Won't go back
5
Firstly make a booking otherwise you probably won't get in after 6pm. Staff are friendly and attentive. Menu is great something for everyone. Pork belly and lamb Schack are the best I have ever tasted. Alcohol costs as much as the meal I thought that was steep. $18 for 1 glass of local beer is ridiculous. Overall nice experience and I will go back next time I'm in Singapore
4
Called in without a reservation and was offered a bench table overlooking the water, excellent position, thanks! the food was delightful, the service was perfectly timed and the staff were excellent. Not cheap but very goo

Dined at BSK last Saturday. The feel of the restaurant is a little odd, it's a little like an upscale pub that is also clearly after the family crowd with kids and tots sighted. Given that I have a child, it's a nice mix. Service is friendly and waiters were prompt in getting to you if you raised your hand to get their attention. Which is honestly an achievement in Singapore where most wait staff are curt and have that 'i wish I had a better job' look!Food wise we tried the taglioni pasta, fish and chips, pork chop and mashed potatoes. The much lauded bread basket unfortunately arrived cold and kinda stale/hard. What a waste given the name of the restaurant, and you can tell the quality of a restaurant honestly - by the way they serve you their bread. The Mashed potatoes we'd ordered as a side also suffered the same fate, quite sad given Gordon Ramsay on his tv shows seems to harp on how to make a good mash. It was stodgy and lukewarm and certainly not silky and creamy like what a great mash should be. Had to ask the staff to warm it up and it came back slightly warmer like it got thrown into the microwave or oven for a few seconds.Taglioni starter was good. Extra points that they served it hot. The fish and chips- also much lauded - had way too salty batter. We're fish and chips fans and honestly no matter how we justified the taste (like maybe the British like it extra salty?) it was still off. Pity that for the price, the fish used wasn't spectacular. Not sure if it's halibut but certainly wasn't cod.Dinghey dell pork chop was not bad and done quite nicely although a little dry. We didn't have much room for dessert this time around. Hope the team can improve as we're keen to go back week after as we're celebrating an occasion.
4
A group of five of us went for drinks and an early dinner. The extensive drinks list is let down by servers who don't really know what they are serving. Wrong gopins delivered etc. At the prices they charge for booze, they should have more knowledgeable staff.Tasty food that was well timed. More than just uk pub grub so you won't be disappointed
4
Had breakfast with my friends. At the beginning, I was skeptical about the breakfast selection, as it seemed limited. However, through it's limited selection, the quality of the breakfast is amongst the best I've had. As for the pricing, it is acceptable according to the location of this outlet. Not forgetting attentive and friendly waiter/waitress.
5
Ate solo at the high tables by the bayside. Staff were very welcoming and the trout I had was amazing. There's a gin menu as well so I tried the Corsair. Bread on arrival was scrumptious and free! Highly recommended
5
Having made a booking before we travelled to Singapore we were 30 minutes early but were shown immediately to a table overlooking the bay in an ideal spot for people watching on Chinese new Year. As the queues formed at the door we ordered from the menu, including drinks. While we waited, not long actually, we examined the space and were most impressed with the interior design and layout, chairs very comfortable to boot. My Pimms and homemade lemonade was spectacular with mint leaves and a raspberry garnish, my husband's G & T was perfect. When our meals arrived the size of my pork belly and husband's steak seemed rather large but as they were each perfectly cooked we managed to demolish them totally, a good thing we had not bothered with breakfast that morning!The service was perfect, not too solicitous but available when needed, polite but not too familiar. All in all, a memorable meal and one we will repeat on our next visit to Singapore
5
I am not good in writing reviews so here is my summary.Visited the restaurant at 25th Jan 2017 with a friend, the food is awesome, both of us ordered the Fish & Chips. It was very good!! Great selection of wines, good view of the Singapore River. Friendly Staff, Food is very affordable too.Will definitely be back here again with my family soon :
4
I can recommend this restaurant. Very Nice waiters, very Good fold, Nice choice of wines. We had a very Nice time here.. not to pricy, and well worth the value.You might also want to try the bar at the backside, was very Nice
5
Went there without a reservation, was so lucky to get a table as the place is always busy.Great food, efficient and friendly and price was fantastic! Had a lovely bottle of champagne and fish n chips, not really the usual gourmet pairing but it was perfect.Will definitely go again

Hubby and I were off to the theatre so booked a table for 6pm so we didn't have to rush. On arrival the hostess made a phone call which didn't sound to great but it turns out she was making sure we had a "nice table upstairs" as we had made a reservation.There is a choice of two menus - Al la Carte and Bar so there was a great choice. Not sure of prices on the bar menu but the Al la Carte was reasonable for what was on offer (no more expensive than elsewhere we'd eaten). We had 2 people looking after our table - a drinks waiter & a food waitress - and both were very attentive but not in your face. When we ordered 2 glasses of the same wine it was suggested we had a carafe instead, which turned out to be better value.Food wise- hubby chose scallops to start (came served in the shells we he said was a bit of pfaff and was missing some black pudding), I chose the crab & apple salad which was fantastic - lots of crab (& not just the crappy brown meat but proper white chunks of meat!), a few slices of apple and a perfect amount of lettuce and sauce - highly recommended!) Having decided on our mains before taking our order our waitress asked if we'd been told the specials (which we hadn't) but promptly both changed our minds and went for the beef wellington. We ordered it cooked medium but I had to send mine back as it was not cooked enough for my taste (hubby's was ideal for him) which was no trouble for the staff at all - in fact they were most apologetic, the maitre d (well I assume that was who he was as he was in a suit) came over and asked if my returned meal was OK and again apologised saying their priority was for their guests to get what they wanted. The meal was great - served with spiced carrots, creamy mash potato & garlic sprouts with two sauces to accompany it. We received individual portions of wellington with a large piece of meat (probably actually enough for two people in one serving!) Desert was cranachan cheesecake (was very rich but missing something) and pineapple carpaccio with pasionfruit and coconut sorbet (very nice but too much pineapple).Overall it was a lovely meal and we'll definitely go back. Service was great, venue is very nice. Well worth a visit

As we were walking through the Marina Bay Sands Shopping complex on my birthday, we came across the " Gordon Ramsey Bread Street Kitchen " and as I commented about seeing it, my husband told me that's where we were having dinner. The reservation was made on line before we left Australia so they knew we were coming by 7pm. He had booked a window table so as to see the Marina Bay and with a zoom lens camera, you could see the Merlion spurting his water into the Bay. We had a mixed grill platter between us with mashed potato and seasoned carrots on the side as well as dipping sauces in little dishes. The meal was reasonably priced as well as very delicious and the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. The waiters and waitresses were there topping up your water as it got low and were always asking that everything was to our satisfaction, ( it was ). After our main meal, we were then shown the dessert menu and we both chose a Raspberry and Apple Crumble, (yum). When they bought them out, my husband was served first and I thought it quite strange that he was served before me, so as I was distracted, a waiter came up on my blind side with a larger plate with my dessert with a lighted candle and Happy Birthday Wendy and a large heart drawn in chocolate around the plate. Three of the waiters then stood around me and sang Happy Birthday and clapped their hands. My husband was then handed a coaster and asked if that was what he wanted, he then handed it to me but said they had got it wrong, it said " Happy Birthday Wendy, from Dave " instead of from :"the staff of the Bread Kitchen". It was still the thought that counted so I didn't mind. Gordon Ramsey was not there at the time we went , but will be some time in March 2017 for a few days, little disappointed we did not get to see him, might have got a free drink out of it. Would definitely go there again if we ever went back to Singapore
5
My Husband and I love this restaurant, great food , awesome drinks And the people there make u feel unique!U can tell them what u would like to have for drinks And they figure it out something for u... the best
4
By way of disclosure I came here for their set Valentine's Day dinner... so I didn't have access to the full menu. And I was a little annoyed by the their initial request that I fill out an authorization form to actually book for it (which they waived after I basically cancelled).. .I mean who has time to print out, fill out, scan and email a form to just book a restaurant?That said, they made the effort to address my annoyance on the night - and their service was pretty good. So compliments to them on that.The food itself was very good.. though it arrived not as hot as it should have (this is what happens when you try to max out your kitchen and staff for commercial reasons). But it did taste very good, and they got the medium-rare filet mignon perfect. A lot of bread is served with and as part of several dishes (hence Bread Kitchen?) so you'll definitely leave feeling very full.The atmosphere was excellent, cosy but not too dim, ample seating space. If I'm being picky I'd recommend to dine on the top floor, as the air on the bottom floor (where the kitchen is) didn't smell as fresh as I'd expect.Low-end mocktails and spirits/beers were reasonably price, but their premium water, spirits and wines was somewhat pricing.Overall I'd definitely worth a visit when they aren't super busy
5
Definitely a must try! Bread Street Kitchen is located perfectly at Marina Bay Sands during the day and I must say that it was veerrryy filling! Their portion sizes are big and it won't let you down! Had the traditional fish & chips which were cooked perfectly and also the saffron risotto which made my tummy feel as if it was being cuddled! The service there is great, and although the restaurant was a bit packed, the waiters did an amazing job to catering to us without a doubt. They were very kind and helpful! I would say that as this is one of Gordon Ramsay's chain of restaurants, prices are high but it is definitely worth it (coming from a student). It's nice to treat yourself to good food, service, & environment every once in awhile. I can't wait for my next visit already!
5
Loved the view, the bread, the starters, the mains, the dessert & drinks! Loved everything about this place! Reservations made over the phone was smooth and simple. When we arrived, the service staff were extremely friendly and pleasant! Had a great date with hubby
5
This place was phenomenal! The food was great and the service was incredible. I was traveling alone and therefore had to celebrate my birthday alone and the staff here made me feel very special and welcome. Truly a great experience :) when you look at the bad reviews of this place it's just whiny people complaining for the sake of complaining. There is no actual substance to the complaints. This place has a high bar set being that it is owned by Gordon Ramsay and this place delivered! Will definitely come back my next trip to Singapore :)
3
We sat outside in a group of 6 - no booking, but they found us a space. The menu was not very adventurous, but something for everyone. No one was overwhelmed by the quality. I had a steak that was done just right, but the side order for it came out 10 minutes later - this was however the star of the show... surprisingly, since it was Brussels sprouts - but baby ones done with onion and bacon - Yum! Maybe just order that
4
I love this place because I've never had to wait to be seated, even when it looks packed. The food is consistently delicious - especially the BSK short rib beef burger - and the service is fast and friendly. The food is a bit pricey, but it's a Gordon Ramsay joint, so you know what to expect when you're going in. They have a great Sunday brunch as well, and at the end of every meal they bring you a jar of cookies to share at the table, free of charge. And those cookies are good
5
Been there very often, nice place to have a gathering. Food and mocktail and cocktail were good. Service thumb up. Worth visiting
5
The imported pilsner was really good.All the bar snacks: Breads, Prawns, Pizza were delicious, staff very helpful and friendly
2
A pretty so so experience. The food was acceptable and came as expected. Service was reasonable. The tableware is a little weird, the steak knife is not correctly weighted and the plates rest in too narrow a base so you feel like your plate is going to tip over al the time.Overall nothing really interesting to say, and that in itself is disappointing
3
Was sat at the bar which had a nice view of the river and the Fullerton hotel. We were promptly served table water which was a nice change from the usual selling of overpriced bottles of water at other fancy restaurants. Shortly after served with bread which was cold. Pity because the bread looked good to eat but needed to be warm. Ordered the Sunday roast. The two slices of roast beef were fine although I ordered medium rare it was more on the medium side. It was pink enough but I do like my beef to be textured so that it starts from being seared on the outside to gradually becoming tar tare in the center. The gravy was full of onion flavor but over seasoned with sugar and salt so it was almost sickly sweet and salty. The accompanying carrots were fine but the parsnips suffered the same sickly sugary coating like they were cooked in sweet syrup. Way too sweet. Way wrong! The roast potatoes luckily didn't suffer the same fate but then texture wise were not great either. They needed to be roasted a little longer. The Yorkshire pudding was fine but without much fanfare. However, the dish wasn't a complete failure. The horseradish mousse that accompanied the dish was absolutely delightful. Never had horseradish that creamy and airy in all my life. Not joking either. It has to be the best horseradish recipe ever. I was spooning it onto everything.Tough one to judge this
4
Enjoyed some very good food and comfortable setting. Highly recommend the Black Cod. A friend ordered the risotto, and I was told that with the prawn it was great, but without it may not have seemed so. Because we're patient, we had a great meal. If you're not patient and expect well trained service, come with an open mind to enjoy this place. I was surprised by the numerous timing errors by the service, so much so that these weren't just mistakes. Food coming out before drinks, clearing table before we were all finished, etc. We simply told the staff to "please bring our drinks first", etc. Ramsey is such an entertainer on TV, yelling at people who make mistakes, it seemed almost comical that here at a restaurant with his name on it, we saw quite a few mistakes. All in all, a good meal on Marina Bay, but room for improvement
3
So we have visited many ramsay restaurants and even stayed at his hotel - York and Albany. I understand this may be acceptable in Singaporean culture but I don't find it acceptable. We had booked and arrived a little early. They were quite amenable and seated us and yes not at window but no issue that view was equally dreadful. Cocktail list was nice and not expensive for Singapore. Skipped Lunch menu as main courses not to our taste. I went with the burger medium - it was served closer to rare and basically mediocre. Hubby fared better with lamb shank which he rated good. Mouse trap cocktail was cute and yummy and banana sticky toffee OK. Overall approx Â£120 for an average lunch. Staff were friendly but I just don't want to look at a mall.

Fish and chips disappointing, found better in Canada! Our waitress was just great, very attentive. Gordon Ramsay brand is too big to sustain quality now.
2
I was regular customer in this place last two visits was disappointing, on January I think well, any one have a bad Day, the food lost the flavor and the passion, second visit on January same, no flavor and the way they presented the dishes also, the bread for the chicken liver and foie gras not the usual for example, by now not at the level they used to have, now became expensive for what you receive for your money.In my opinion they changed the Chef. I considering one more visit to check again, I send a few friends there for a birthday celebration and was very disappointed, so is not only my wife, son and my self opinion is general, a restaurant with this level must keep the quality, if not is one more place to eat, just to go there if no options around or for the Ramsey's Name.Check the bread in the basket, and the greasy onions and food

Reviews for this Gordon Ramsey outpost are all over the map, but on a recent Sunday evening we had a wonderful experience. The location IS w-a-y at the end of the mall, but we loved the gin and tonic choices, yes, you can specify the tonic from many exotic bottlings, loved the Yorkshire pudding with roast beef and my friends were VERY happy with the fish and chips. Lovely server and service, no complaints! We'd happily return
4
Good food, good friendly servers but price on the high side.Pork belly skin is a bit hard,; Saffron Risotto is very flavourful
4
Went for lunch/ dinner. Got a bar table which was nice facing the front outside.The food was nicely presented and tasting great. We had the meat platter and the burger. Staff was attentive and very accommodating to our needs
3
For some odd reason, it seems to be getting difficult to find good Western food in Singapore at decent prices. Bread Street Kitchen was a perfect example. While my entree was great, my mains of fish and chips weren't that spectacular. The fish tasted strange and the batter was way too thick. Left feeling a little unwell. On the upside the service is great; friendly and efficient
1
Had the set lunch. Starters were bland and tasteless. The main (braised ox cheek) was very sweet, the carrots were stewed and the mash was average. The whole meal left a strange taste in your mouth. My wife found the main inedible. Puddings were O

Went down for brunch at this Gordon Ramsay restaurant and I would say that there's nothing really special going on in there. I felt like we are just paying because of the name itself. The place was indeed good, I liked the rustic theme interior, however when I saw the coffee cups used (shown in the photo) I felt like the theme has just been blown away. Moreover, the staff uniforms were not "uniform" . It is just disturbing to look around not identifying who is who going to your table. The service itself was not that impecable. Staff were helpful but I would say not friendly enough. I did not really feel guest interaction as they are all seems busy and rushing. Food, nothing special. Being a celebrity restaurant, I am expecting more but didnt get that any wow factor when the food arrived. I even took a better photo of the bread as it looks nicer rather than the mains itself. Prices of the food are fairly similar to such. It was acceptable. Overall, its not a terrible experience neither a memorable one. There are plenty more room for improvement , I would say. But if asked whether I will be coming back for the second time, I would have to think twice.
3
Stopped for a cool beer on a hot day.The staff were friendly as you would expect, but the bill..... "Wow" as Gordon Ramsay would say.$40 for 2 local beers.That's about Â£12 each in real money!At that price I would have expected the craggy faced maestro of serve me himself! Thank goodness I didn't have a bag of pork scratchings as well....
3
Mediocre food compared to Ramsey's usual restaurants (London, New York, etc), but good cocktails and friendly service.
4
Went for lunch. Scallops & Risotto : Decent but definitely not what you expect at a Gordon's Restaurant since these are basics. Main course was good. Dessert was average.Excellent location & very professional staff
5
This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore. When I have friends to visit I make sure this is high on the list of places to go. The food is incredible- I usually have pork belly. My friend had the burger and she asked for well done, but it came raw. She still ate most of it, but when we mentioned it they were very apologetic and they provided us with a complimentary dessert. It is quite pricey for drinks, but the atmosphere and food is incredible. This is a must when coming to Singapore.

I took my 10 year old daughter. We got a table without reservation. Loved the view of the marina area. The service was excellent and not at all stuffy. My daughter got a kids pack, which she loved. The bread basket and butter were delicious, as was the steak pie. I don't normally have desert but decided to give it a go. It was also yummy. Can't wait to go back, when I am next back in Singapore. Price was good, I had two glasses of wine which were expensive, but that's Singapore for you
2
The place is not bad in general. The interior is nice. The food was not bad but I expected more for such a price. This place is very expensive! Visited this place a couple of times and every time the stuff looked exhausted. I even heard a couple of times the GM( John if I am not mistaken) yelling and swearing at them( I am quite sure he was drunk) . The worst was that visitors could hear it. it's quite difficult to get a table there and I don't really understand why
4
The food and cocktails were nice. Staff was attentive. The pineapple carpaccio was average.No placemats?The utensils were touching the table directly. Not so clean I guess...Overpriced like everything in Singapore
3
Group of friends went there for Sunday brunch.Food was good though very simple and it would not take you more than 10mn cooking such brunch at home.However portions were far too small for a cost of SGD25 pp. Still hungry after the brunch.No value for money due to the quantity and could get far better in Singapore. Obviously a restaurant targeting tourists.We won't come back
4
We did not have a reservation but we were lucky to get a table. The service was good, quick, friendly and attentive. The food was good albeit a bit pricey. Overall, a nice experience
5
This is a great place to eat, drink and relax with superb staff. Food is really good and out of the 5 nights we were here we always made sure we stopped by for a night cap before going back to the hotel. If you can't get a table just sit at the bar and eat, chill and have a chat with the staff. Special thanks to Alessio and William for making our nights here special times to remember for u
4
Nice atmosphere with cosy lights and some table outside viewing the marina. Food were good specially kids menu. Burger and fries with their own ketchup. Kid's buyer comes on 2 small buns and burger which is smart for kids. Not so expensive although they have big advertising about Gordon Ramsey and so on. There will be line outside the restaurant for lunch and late for dinner otherwise it is OK to find seat
4
Family visit was enjoyable, my daughter loves fish and chips and she wasn't disappointed. 2 glasses of wine, 2 main meals and a child's meal cost 140 dollars and therefore won't give it 5 stars:-)Quality of food and wine was excellent
5
This is the third time I've been and I don't know why I haven't reviewed it before, it's excellent. It's priced at the same level as lots of chain restaurants but the food and service are at the highest level. This restaurant compares with the best restaurants in Singapore (or any where else) but at really affordable prices.Service is outstandin
5
We have been to this restaurant 3 times now and decided to try their brunch which was delicious apart from a small issue with the poached eggs we ordered. The maitre d' took charge immediately with an apology and offer of replacing the whole dish or the eggs. This was done without fuss and so professionally. The replacement eggs were perfect and attention to detail really good. The test of an excellent restaurant is the way they deal with problems and the staff at this restaurant especially the maitre d' were superb. Thoroughly recommend and look forward to our next visit... perhaps the Sunday Roast
4
We booked a couple of days in advance online, which was a good idea as there was a line outside when we arrived.It is located in a great spot with views over the to Clarke Quay. The restaurant is nice and cosy with a good vibe about it. You can still have a good conversation at the table and hear what is going on.The food was fantastic, we started with the grilled prawns and pasta to share. It was enough for three. The must try was the lamb shank and pork belly, we couldn't get enough of it. We finished with the cheesecake and snickers slice for dessert. What more can we say.A nice touch was the cookies at the end. My only feedback was that service was a bit slow, but it was a busy night.Well worth the effort and finished off a great trip for us
5
What can I say?? Good or awesome?? Scallop is one of the best i have tasted. Cocktails are tip top. Well done guys
5
Had dinner here on our last night as a treat. Food is expensive but excellent. The service was supreme and I want to mention our waiter by name - Leonarno. He made the experience so should be congratulated
5
Have got change to try !! Bread street by godan Ramsay !!Best rib eye steak I have try it !!Scallop was award winning !!Fan static service !!Kudos to entire team ! For there great hospitality
5
I will be honest, I had dined at Ramsey's fine dining in London and was unimpressed by the lack of creativity. Basic meat and taters. So when a friend suggested this I was hesitant to fork out a bunch of money for a "celebrity restaurant" part of the Marina Sands casino complex. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The service was great. And I had not had good service since moving from the US to Australia. By that I mean they checked on us throughout the meal, answered all questions and kept my water refilled (hallelujah!). The location was terrific, and if you want to hit many celebrity restaurants they're all there. We had a view of the Marina and as the lights came up in the city it was great. As a FYI if you have a private function you'd like to host, they have a private room.We had the foie gras with a wonderful gelee on top w brioche of course. Also ordered the watermelon salad - feta, avocado and more goodies. The flavors in these two dishes were just outstanding. Layers of sweet, sour, spice were just right. The duck breast was cooked perfectly at medium with a tamarind glaze and sauce on the side. Crispy kale and French lentils and hummus were all a perfect match for the sweet sour of the tamarind. Lentils were a bit undercooked but the texture worked!We were two women having a meal. We saw others like us, families, business folks and dress was all over the place - very casual to business attire. They're open for breakfast thru late dinner. The entire Marina, casino etc is accessible by train but there are cabs everywhere. I'll post photos from my phone later. While reservations aren't required - I would suggest you make them if you have your heart set on eating there on a particular day or time. Bon appetit

Visited the place a bit suspicious about quality and service but need to admit we got an excellent meal. Great service and very friendly lady attentive to all our needs. Food took a little longer to get ready, so Chef sent a nice duck pâté so we could calm down our hunger..Sunday Roast is really delicious and very well prepared..Fully recommended..

We enjoy Gordons food that we cook at home from his cookbooks so thought we’d try his restaurant this time around while in Singapore.Not quite the experience we perhaps expected. The thing we liked the most about the night was the Gingerbread man cocktail.When the waitress sat us at our table she sat us right up in the corner (on the shopping mall side) next to a waiters stations where all the cutlery, water bottles etc. are all we could think about is all the banging and clanking as we dined so we asked her if we could move over to a window seat on marina bay side that was empty and she quite abruptly told us it’s taken. We then asked a table waiter who had no issues with moving us to that table.Food wasn’t anything special we shared a couple of entrees, mains and a dessert and both thought the same thing, we won’t be rushing back
5
Lambshank smelled great, tasted excellent. My girlfriends cod looked good and had a matching taste. Friendly staff with great service. Little pricy, but its singapore, and so worth it
4
Back to dine at bsk for a casual lunch, been wanting to try out the rib eye steak. The steak was cook to a perfect medium and the taste was pretty good. But in terms of the cut of steak, I would still prefer the sirloin steak as it is leaner and that is still personal preferences. Maybe back to have the sirloin steak again sometime soon
5
Visited with family for dinner on the basis of having visited Ramsey's BSK in Hong Kong. Celebrity restaurants can often be very pretentious but the service at BSK was excellent and surpassed only by the food. I associate Ramsey with beef Wellington and this was my first opportunity to try it. It was as good as I imagined and a very generous serve. The beef was cooked to perfection. Even better though was the Monkey Shoulder cheesecake...wow! It was exceptional! Do yourself a favour and visit this restaurant...you won't be sorry
3
The only nice thing was the quality of the cod and the fried crust! The tartar was nothing but a mayo and basic spices such as salt and pepper seem to have been unknown in the kitchen. However the philippino guy in the bar made it worth while
4
The restaurant appears to be very popular. We tried a couple of times to book a table for 6 for dinner but in vain.We had lunch instead. The food was good but not fantastic. The Spicy Salmon Tartare, Pork Belly, Steak & creme brûlée were good. We didn't really like the Risotto & Fish Pie though.Lovely View of Marina Bay. Friendly & attentive staff. Pricey
5
Came in late to Marina Bay Sands and was looking for food for hungry teenagers at 9pm - wondered over to the Marina bay shopping complex and found Gordon Ramsay's restaurant - dint know if we could get in but lined up with a few other people and after only a few minutes got four seats sitting at the bar - awesome venue inside and the bartender was an excellent host - the menu choices offer a fantastic variety - we opted for scallops and crab pasta as entree and then went for pork belly and angus steaks -all cooked to perfection and served with the best chips and onion rings I've tasted for quite some time - they also had roasts specials and xmas fare - plus of course the bread that they make and offer was to die for! The value for four of us was extremely good given we had a few expensive wines - food wise great value and flavours are wonderful, we went back a few days later and sat down near the chefs and watched them prepare, a really great experience to see how hard they work and so dedicated to their craft - a must try for anyone visiting singapore
5
During our trip to Singapore we booked the Bread Street Kitchen for my birthday. We had a great night with good food, atmosphere and service. The restaurant was really busy but we where still served in a timely manner. Great night thank you
4
Went there as part of my company group get together dinner. We ordered lamp chop, Irish Angus rib-eye steak, Dingley Dell Pork and a couple of side dishes (chips, onion rings, spice carrots, macaroni cheese, etc). The grills were succulent, very well done! Everyone of us seemed to be enjoying our meals greatly. This is one of the restaurant that you might consider for some special occasions
4
Got a table at once, even though the place was full. The bread was good, no starters, the cod for main was perfect! Also had the onion rings as a side (which wasn't really necessary), they didn't taste that much. Had the shared platter for dessert, we got to choose 3 things from the regual menu. We choose the chocolate fondant, which was excellent, the bread toffee cake was ok, and the pinapple carpaccio was also really good. Came to about 250$ with a caraffle of red wine included. We will be back to try the monkfish and the duck
3
Visited the Marina Bay location in Singapore with my family. The food was good with the exception of the chips and the fish batter. The chips were obviously frozen, which the waiter later confirmed. The fish itself was excellent quality but the oil used to cook it was obviously spent, the batter was dark and burnt. The soup we had as an appetizer was served with desert spoons. I expected the experience to be a little better.
4
Food was nicely prepared and quite good. Ambience is relaxing and comfy. Staff was I felt little cold at the reception but once seated the servers were warm and friendly. Recommend to others. The breakfast looks great too.
4
My wife and I had a quick lunch at this Gordon Ramsay eatery in Singapore. This location offers a sort of English pub/eatery vibe and is meant to mimic its London counterpart.As is typical with Gordon Ramsay, you do pay a bit of a premium to eat at restaurants bearing his name and sometimes I am not sure it is worth the premium paid. Although any experience I've had at Gordon Ramsay's has been a good one and all the dishes prepared and presented with near perfection. Bread Street Kitchen was good. My wife and I had the chance to try the beef carpaccio to start (it was delicious). We also had a chance to try Ramsay's take on English fish and chips with mushy peas and it was also a nice light lunch item and very tasty.I would not necessarily recommend visiting this restaurant if you are in Singapore as there are so many other cheap and authentic Asian food choices to be had in Singapore's many food hawker centres why eat at an English/European eatery? However, if you are spending the day in The Shoppe at Marina Bay, then you may want to consider Bread Street Kitchen for a quick bite
5
Had Christmas dinner here today and could not fault anything about it. Food was amazing and great portion size, we enjoyed traditional Christmas turkey dinner and it was outstanding. Service was excellent and staff very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely return, pity we are just here on holiday. If I have to be picky about anything downstairs restaurant looks out to shopping mall, so no nice view to enjoy but upstairs has better outlook
4
 we are here for lunch today for the first time. the place was split into two levels, our table was located upstairs. they put us at the bar table with the high stools which is inconvinient as we were with small kids. the server was very kind (caucasian guy). i ordered the saffron risotto, the rice texture was excellent but the whole dish was a bit to watery to my licking, as im a fanatic when it comes to risottos. Flavour wise, it was brilliant. the Mrs ordered the trout, very nice. Mac & cheese was very good and tasty. Pumpkin soup was the best...and the Pimm's was perfect! will definitely come back here and will try other dishes.. ;)
3
We have high expectation on the food as this is one of the famous Chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. However, it was a bit disappointing on the food that we had back then. Maybe that's was only our expectation towards the foods. Anyway, the overall environment of the restaurant was good and we enjoyed the ambiance there. They have friendly and professional staff. Worth trying and maybe you have different view to share :
4
Went there for lunch and thought it was ok. Had the set lunch which was nice especially the appetizer of salmon tartare. Had the fish pie which was ok. My wife had the fish n chips which was again ok though not great. Think we had much better fish and chips at a seaside chippery in Newlyn. Service was excellent though and the staff were very attentive
5
We were at Restaurant first time for anniversary dinner, this was and amazing dinner the price, portions, quality and presentation of the food and incredible service, we tried first visit the Code fish and pork belly was excellent the delicacy of the flavors are at the expected Ramsey Fame.After this experience we made a subsequent visits to explore the menu and we almost finished to try all mainly dinner menu, the pork T-bone wow, you are trap after first visit.If you are looking for good food, ambience and excellent service this by far is one of the best options in Singapore.Enjo
5
I went just to experience the food...I must say it was the best at bay front.Enjoyed Every bit of it.Thanks for the nice ambience too
4
On a hot and humid Saturday in December we had just completed our 4 hour walk in Singapour ! The restaurant staff greeted us very warmly and professionally so we booked for a late lunch, after we showered at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, next door. The restaurant is one of the chain of the TV famous chef Gordon Ramsay, we did not know what to expect and this has been a great surprise! Food was fresh, the scallops were perfectly braised, the fish and chips fantastic. The Australian wine matched perfectly our meal and we even had a little bit more space for chocolate dessert. We did not expect to experience a nice meal in such touristic area. We will be back, for sure
3
As the name blurts it out, the best thing about the place is it's freshly baked bread and butter to go with it. They provide you with different types of breads, breadsticks, etc and they're all yummilicious! We went for lunch for my wife's birthday and they were kind enough to ask at the time of booking if it was for an occasion? They brought the dessert out with a 'Happy Birthday' message and sang her the birthday song. This was a nice touch and the service overall was good. The food however fell short. We ordered one set lunch and one person ordered from the A la carte. For the main, we chose beef cheeks from the set lunch menu and lamb shank from the A la carte. No one bothered to point out to us that both were cooked in exactly the same style, with the same gravy and veggies! To be fair the meat was cooked well. I wouldn't be going back in a hurry though. Jaime's would be a far better choice in Singapore between the two chefs
5
surprised my wifey with a visit to this fine restaurant after our shopping session. very nice interior and comfortable set up. we ordered a tagliolini with lobster and white wine sauce and a roasted sea trout as the mains. we had coffee and and a wonderful dessert after that (curse me as i forgot the name...!!) . the taste and the way they were served is just splendid. very happy to dine here and will definitely visit again when i come to singapore
5
Dinner at MBS and finally try out this restaurant after so long. Super love with the Italian wine Chianti and goes well with the duck breast. Freshly baked bread basket was served and their butter was so far the best I had in Singapore. Feel like back to Italy again after tasting the butter n bread. Black cod fish doesn't failed us too. Overall it's a good try.
4
It is pricy of course Gordon Remsey but the food was niceDrinks were aaaaamazzzzzzingAnd the staff is professional and helpful
5
Couple for dinner.Very high quality, pleasant, friendly and well-informed service. We would go back just for the service experience - so far above the Singapore norm.Menu contains some fine dining dishes, particularly in the starters, plus some more relaxed menu items and even comfort food in the mains (like a burger and fish n chips). My spicy tuna tartare was excellent, though heavily influenced by sesame. Now I really like the flavour and fragrance of toasted sesame; but if that's not for you then there are lots of other good choices.We had the vegan risotto which presented very well. The rice grains were perfectly cooked and still individual; just right.Also had the black cod. Interestingly presented with a red wine and lemon sauce. This was an achievement as the flavoursome sauce complemented the full-flavoured fish without dominating. Serving temperature was the only downside, and an ambient temperature plate detracted from what otherwise was a great dish. My meal was cold before I could finish.The 'snickers' style desert is a must - but it is sizeable! A wonderful treat. The mouse-style cheesecake was also very pleasing. Can recommend both.Now, the one MAJOR downside is the location. Its great to sit facing the boardwalk - its buzzy and fun. But inside the centre is full of tourists and screaming kids and prams and geriatrics and....you get the picture. We had to queue for about a year for the toilets, or so it seemed. Totally inadequate support environment for an otherwise great dining experience
5
amazingly memorable meal at BSK Singapore paired with affluent service and knowledgable serving staff. I will be difanyely back agai
3
The average place for meals at MBS. The selections on the menu from Gordon Ramsy should be better than this
5
Seasons greetings,Great delicious hearty food..vibrant ambience and pleasant atmosphere,value for money...phenomenal service...prestigious and amazing staff..beautiful location across the waterfront..food quality served at comepletey differently dimensional level.one the finest cocktails and world class wines served right at the table.staff was absolutely coopreative.great thanks.happy new year to Management
2
Have tried for dinner and then brunch a few weeks later. Two chances to get it right .. but the service was horrible both times, especially for brunch. Were given menus right away but sat for 15 minutes before our order was taken â€“ and that after we literally got up and walked to the bar counter to request a person to give our order to. We should have walked out actually, because we were all annoyed for the remainder of the meal. Which was delicious. The food taste and quality is excellent, no complaints whatsowever. But portions are too small and the cost too high. For example, a smoothie cost around $10 and it was served in a tiny little glass. It was good but this does not match up with the high cost, small portions and pathetic service. Would not recommend this place despite taste and quality of dishes
2
Always watch Gordon Ramsay tv shows and hoping that I can try his foods. Since his new restaurant recently open in Singapore, I was eager to try.Sadly it was a big disappointment. I ordered pasta and my wife tried the risotto. The pasta was undercooked and crunchy. Doesn't taste good. And somehow it taste and smell like tap water. Poorly executed.But my wife said the risotto was Ok. But overall, it was a bad experience. Not worth a try. Too pricey for a low standard food
5
Located by the waterfrant,engjoy the british european menu with fresh seasonal produse and drinrs at the bar with wekk-known classics fan cocktails and large collection of world wines.Recomend it
4
I love Gordon Ramsay and this was my first experience dining in one of his restaurants. The service was impeccable from start to finish. The wine I had a 2007 Bordeaux was beautiful. I like the menu concept, and the food I had was prepared well and tasted great. Bill total came to over 100 GBP each for two of us and while the experience was good, I have had better
4
Super cozy restaurant with very friendly staff. The food was really good - especially the king prawns. Watching the buzzing promenade while you eat is great entertainment
4
We went here for a treat on our honeymoon. I was really impressed with the menu selection and excellently catered for various dietary requirements with multiple menus. The food quality was high. The seabass ceviche was particularly good. I had the duck as my main and that was also excellent quality. Nice wine selection and high quality service but strange to have no toilets and have to use the nearby shopping centre facilities instead.
5
The atmosphere is pleasant in this restaurant and the service is efficient and friendly. The quality of food is excellent and good value for money
5
My go to every time I come to Singapore. It's a great atmosphere with fantastic staff and excellent food. This return visit being no exception. Got my drinks squared away...food well seasoned well done...john and team took amazing care of us. what more can u ask for?
5
It was our second visit to Bread Street kitchen and it was just as good as the first but the service was even better this time.I don't recall the waitresses name but she was excellent, attentive and suggesting options when we asked but most of all, brilliant with the kids
5
A really amazing kids' friendly restaurant with great ambiance, excellent service and delectable food. Had an amazing experience ther
5
Had a great time there, service was excellent. Kept asking if anything is missing or how is the food . Beef wellington was exceptional. And since it was a anniversary they offered complimentary dessert.
5
Food was excellent and the service was excellent, as always Mr.Manu gave us outstanding hospitality. Will definitely recommend this venue to friends.
4
Second Visit to this place, this time for a Team Lunch.Everyone enjoyed a lot & had good time.Amazing Food with Attentive service.Will defiantly visit again soon.
3
We popped in here for lunch, as we were over from the UK, big fans of Mr Ramsay and thought it'd be nice to try one of his places out. The food was good and the service was quick and good. But for the price, and with a name like Ramsay behind it; we were expecting the food to be pretty special. It wasn't, it was just good. Fairly uncomplicated, and a little bland frankly. I think it needs to up its game a bit personally, but maybe this was just due to a lunchtime chef or something.
5
An amazing place with mouthwatering food , perfect ambiance and excellent service . Cant miss this place on any of or visit to Singapore.
3
Even though we couldn't get a table and sat at the bar, the service was outstanding. The manager, Manu was extremely engaging as well as the rest of the staff. The food was average. Didn't come out hot, a bit undercooked. But I'd definitely give the ambience a 5 star
5
We had really a wounderful quality time spend this beautiful Restaurant!!Food was really mouth watering !!Excellent service attention ! One of the best experience!!Must visit !!
1
We've had some good experiences here in the past - it's close to work and we like the outside benches particularly as the sun sets. We fancied a quick bite to eat and tried again. But third time unlucky.......There was no one outside nor indeed seemingly inside yet they went through the silly process of checking bookings to see if there was space although totally empty...they're not alone in this and we just go along with it.We got shown to our preferred outside bench and started to review the menu - then we quickly noticed the intrusive music and crappy little tinny speakers. On asking for it to be turned down a little (pointing out no one else was there and we would soon be on our way) the manger told us he was actually going to turn it up! And he did. Extraordinary! So bye bye! We went to the DB Cafe a few doors away and had a lovely steak instead
4
BSK is one of those restaurants where vegetarians will find it difficult to come up with something they like. What we did get was definitely edible - some starters and a pasta. However, BSK has probably decided that salt is injurious to one's health, and so the diner has to decide on how much salt needs to be added without injuring himself! The ambience of the place is pretty decent; and the decibel levels higher than expected. A good place, but poor choices for vegetarians.
3
The food is nothing that you would go out of your way to try or do a return visit. The outstanding item is the view from the bar seats looking out over the water with the backdrop of the Singapore CBD lighted at night and people strolling along the waters edge.
5
Back again at BSK for lunch, to my surprise the front house lady with black silky hair(didn't get her name maybe next time:)) actually remembers me and greeted me(both visit) and told me welcome back. I seldom see this kind of service in other restaurant around SG which to me is a plus point.It was 2 separate visit but was here to try their 2 most popular dish which is the fish and chips and the BSK burger. For me, I would recommend you to try the BSK burger as the patty was really delicious, cooked to the perfect doneness you request. If not, just notify the server or manager and I believe they would gladly change it and re-fire for you. Also order the organic english breakfast tea and it comes in a pot with warm milk the side.Service was great as usual. Price may be a little expensive for some of the food menu but since it is located at MBS with amazing view of the waterfront, I would think it is consider pretty reasonable. Prefer to book the table at around 230pm - 3pm to escape the lunch crowd. Maybe pork belly to try next?  Have a good day ahead to whoever is reading this;
5
Great view nice place to people watch warm hosts and good service!Get a pitcher of pimms a twist on the scotch eggs and you're good to go :
2
Superbly situated ,aesthetic surrounds but incredibly noisy-terrible acoustics.The food was only average-what was supposed to be couscous was small pasta balls-we were not advised!The bill did not reflect Gordon Ramsay's philosophy's of restaurant operatio

Located under the Marina Bay Sands / outside the shopping complex, Bread makes for a great spot to have a long lunch or enjoy a balmy Singapore evening. Fronting onto the pedestrian area it's great to watch all the folk passing by and the activities on the arena. Has free wifi (a must do now days), great cocktails, very good service, excellent music, and the food is pretty good too

Gosh, the minister of finance and I expected something to be amiss when we visited our first GR restaurant. This was not to be, it was great and apart from the wine not quite being what we wanted ( due to my poor explanation of what I wanted) this was good food. The bread was great, an interesting mix of different breads done really well. We shared the tamarind and coriander chicken wings was fantastic. I couldn't fault it, and the smell was divine. The crunch of the skin of the wings consistent and a step above. We both then had the pork belly. What can I say, the consistency of the crackling was great, the meat just right it was fantastic and coupled with the carrots and mash, I rolled out of there full as a goog. I will go back and that is the best recommendation I can make.

For my friends' birthday, we decided to book and have dinner at Bread Street Kitchen. Being Gordon Ramsey fans and chef ourselves, we were excited for the offerings at his place. Service. We arrived at the place and was greeted by the hostess whom is welcoming. She let us read the menu first while fixing our table. Once seated we looked at the menu and the waiter asked us for drinks first. To make the long story short, I really liked how welcoming and how customer focused the service staffs are at this place. Being a Filipino myself, I was really proud of them because the service they gave me was really superb. They keep on checking us regarding our order or our drink. Since it was a birthday celebration, they even prepared something special. It was really a two thumbs up! Food. Honestly, we were kind of disappointed regarding the food. They were not bad but they're are not so good also. Maybe we were expecting more since we ourselves are also cooks and Gordon Ramsey has a reputation for himself. The lamb chop was medium rare but they insisted it was medium like what we ordered. We didn't want to ruin our night so we just asked nicely to recook the lamb for us. As I've said, the food we ordered was good but not so excellent. Overall, the ambiance and the service really made the night for me. I wish they can improve on the food and keep up the good work with regards to pleasing the customers. I will definitely come back to this place and have a good time again.

Nice looking place for casual modern British cuisine. Started with the salad which was average. Onion rings was doughy and not crispy. Fish & chips, the mainstay of British food, was good except that the potion was tiny. The fish could be finished in 3-4 mouthfuls. Chips was really soggy. Pork chop was a disappointment - it was tasteless and certainly lacks seasoning. The famous pork belly was well made and tasty. So was the apple pie. Service was friendly but not always attentive. Overall, an average experience - being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I thought it could do much better

Went for lunch, staff invited us in with a warm welcome and gave us a lovely table. We ordered traditional fish and chips and a burger with fries. These are simple and common dishes, so we expected them to be perfect especially since the prices are high! The rib burger was cooked to perfection, but the fish was slightly under cooked on one side and the two pieces were stuck together. We reserve a table for dinner to try other dishes. We were approximately 5 minutes late and receptionist told us our table was in the lower level. We expected a table on top to enjoy the night lights of Singapore. After expressing our disappointment to the lower level reception, the problem was rectified very professionally. We went back upstairs and we were given a seat at the bar with water while our table being prepared. As soon as we sat down I noticed the table was sticky so I had to ask to get it cleaned again, which shouldn't happen! However the food made up for it. Appetizer was sriracha king prawns with mango salad which was delicious. Main was sirloin cooked perfectly and slow cooked pork belly also perfect. Wine and cocktails and dessert were exceptional. Also like complimentary cookies. Servers were very attentive staff was friendly but evening receptionist ( white girl with black hair) was texting while we waited for our bill.Overall good experience.Daniel & Hannah

I love the ambience of the restaurant. My favourite dish had to be pork belly and french fries! Need to reserve table in advance for dinner as it's usually packed
5
I managed to get a last minute reservation. The service from the moment I walked in until the end was attentive. The staff was able to provide recommendations and understood the menu in detail. The serving sizes are large, so bring an empty stomach. The food itself was everything you would expect from a fine dining restaurant and a 'celebrity chef' with its name to the restaurant. I will certainly come back to BSK when in Singapore again
4
The restaurant environment is one of the best! The only down side is the menu which has limited variety and doesn't seem to change. The service is great as usual and the bread is awesome!

It was with great anticipation that, finally, i will get to sample the Great Gordan Ramsey's fare. After years of watching him eviscerate 'chefs' from Kitchen Nightmare to Masterchef, it was time to see what the fuss was about. First of all, reservations are a must. We were told at the door that there was a 15 minute wait. Which wasnt a problem. The person did come by and gave us an assurance that we would be seated within 5 minutes which was a nice touch. Since it was a Sunday and we already had breakfast, we ordered the chicken liver and the gammon steak. The food was served within 5 minutes!Â  The chicken liver foie gras parfait starter was simply fabulous! A very lovely creamy dish. A meal in itself.The gammon steak dish however was inconsistent. The steak itself was moist and beautifully well cooked. However, the chef was a little too liberal with the salt. The egg was a tad burnt at the bottom. Verdict: The chicken liver foie gras was outstanding. The gammon steak...well, could have been better. I certainly would make my way back for the mains!

Gordon Ramsey ,extremely disappointed ...If I were you I'd stop throwing plates on the floor of the participants of master chef You should throw a lot of them from your own restaurant.Fish and chips extremely oilyMashed potatoes -very saltyAt least the espresso was decen
5
We sat upstairs and were very pleased with everything from the service to the food offering including for our 9 year old.The food was fantastic along with our matched wines with our main course. Would eat here again in a heart beat
2
Terrible service; dragged upstairs to eat, which is not what we wanted. Left for ages before someone took our order for drinks,and then waited even longer before the drinks were served. Food was good but the service was terrible. Very expensive as well. Given the dearth of places to eat, i would avoid this one like the plague
1
Nice location, unfortunately cannot say the same about food, we had several different dishes, they all were flat, no taste at all. A combination of a lot of ingredients without any clue. They messed up even the fish and chips for the kids.Personally i had mushroom creamy past with egg, pasta over cooked that was breaking so easily that at the end it looked like a soup. the taste was just of a ton of fresh cream with pasta and no tasty of mushroom at all.Sad as it was a very expensive dinner as well.Definitely i cannot recommend this place
5
Had the most amazing belly pork! Chips were ace. Not cheap though but worth the extra few dollars!! The chips were $16 I think.
4
Overall enjoyable experience and we would go back again. Food was generally good but a bit inconsistent. My pork chop was excellent but the fish & chips was overcooked and a bit tasteless. Steak was ok but no more than that. Starters and dessert were good. Service was excellent and staff were attentive and very helpful, answering my question about a wine that another table had ordered and brining me the bottle to look at. Not cheap but you have to keep in mind the location
3
too noisy, difficult to read menu in poor lighting, that being said the best pork bellies rates right up there, maybe being from aus thought the price of lamb chops was over the to

I have wanted to go to this restaurant for a long time but even on a weeknight you can't just walk in; apparently people make reservations three months in advance. I have been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in London, Maze, and it was a great experience; I had high hopes for this one too.I finally managed to make a booking for our second wedding anniversary this month and I really looked forward to it. The night was still good, but somehow I expected much more in such a highly-regarded chef's restaurant. Maze is so much better.For starters, we had the watermelon salad (with avocado, feta, rocket, pumpkin seeds, and balsamic) and the cider-onion soup. The soup was good but the avocado was going brown when it was served. It also gave me that soggy taste like it had been sitting for a while. The only sliced bread in the basket was also stale, though the rolls were good, and in the second basket of bread we got the sliced bread was also good. And the lemon butter was fantastic!I had the braised lamb shank, which was recommended by the staff and he was right; it was really tender and fragrant. The mashed potatoes were good too, very creamy. My husband had the special ribeye steak which was good as well. He also ordered a tomato and red onion salad, and that was disappointing, clearly not freshly made. The tomatoes had been sitting in their juice and dressing so long (there was enough to drink at the bottom of the bowl) that they were soggy and ragged. We didn't finish it.The drinks were fine but my Niyog Island was heavy on the ice.Overall I think it was still a fine dining experience but I must say we were disappointed in some of the dishes. Given the price range, the location, and most importantly the reputation of the owner, I would say there is surely some room for improvement

Celebrated my birthday with a dinner at Bread Street Kitchen and I have to say that I was not disappointed at all! My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food! We ordered the tamarind chicken wings for starters. The sauce was delicious. It had an interesting and unique taste to it. Our favourite was the duck breast! It was cooked to perfection! To end off our dinner, we had the BSK dessert platter (monkey shoulder cheesecake, banana toffee pudding and chocolate fondant). Even though we enjoyed the entire dessert platter, we found the monkey shoulder cheescake to be the unique one of them all. I am a fan and will always remain a fan of Gordon Ramsay! We would also like to thank the waiter (didn't manage to get his name) for providing us with good and genuine customer service. We will be back for more

Great location, table service and (mostly) food. Casual but a fine dining price. During her mid term break my daughter wanted to go to a fancy place so we came here. You should book as its v popular. Came here for Sunday brunch, though became more like a lunch.The location is super with the main level looking out over Marina bay. When we reached, were told our table was reserved at the lower level. No one would choose that and as we had booked we asked for a table at main level, and got it. Should have been offered from the start. This pissed me off, but our waitresses service was so good, it charmed me.Singapore tap water is quite safe so you needn't pay for bottled water. The bread and butter was superb. The quantities are large so you needn't order starters. My kids devoured their steak, my wife liked her gluten free burger, but my lamb chops were so so. Their fresh juices are great. My kids also enjoyed the chocolate fondant dessert from the kids menu. They have a gluten free and dairy free menu as well.While we were there I went downstairs to check out the lower level. I expected it to be a closed dark place, but as it looked out into the shopping area in B1 it was quite ok. But obviously best place to eat is at level 1, including the outside tables

We went here on a whim, as we were famished and this was the restaurant closest to us.The Good:1. Service was prompt and very friendly and helpful. 2. Nice view of the promenade.3. Generous serving of bread before the meal, and cookies after the meal. I thought the cookies were a specially cute touch, since no other place offers this.4. Some of the food was reasonable in taste.5. They actually serve regular water, and thank heavens, because I hate all these other pretentious places that only offer bottled water or sparkling water, and then charge you a bomb for it, that too in Singapore that has clean, filtered water available in taps !The Not-so-good:1. The lady who ushered us in was rather curt and unfriendly, stating that we would have to finish within an hour because we didn't have a reservation and because the next reservation was in an hour's time. We agreed, but she kept insisting and being curt. Left a bad taste on our palettes, which was thankfully made much better by the service of all the other staff.2. This place is more hype than quality. And very expensive. I wasn't impressed by the dishes we ordered at all, and I was expecting a great experience given the "Gordon Ramsay" brand-name. We ordered trout and cod and the trout tasted so bland even with the white wine dressing ! I could make better fish than this at home. The Kale salad was tasty but a bit too crunchy. Even though I love salads, this one required a hell of a lot of chomping. The food only served to reinforce the cliche: British food is Bland, even though I'm not a believer of cliches.3. The place has a dark ambiance ... saving on electricity bills?I'm definitely not wasting time, money or experience to come here again, since Singapore has such a plethora of restaurants way better than this
4
The service was excellent and the food was very good. I had the steak and it was really nice. The complimentary bread and cookies at the end add to the experience of eating here. The overall ambiance of the restaurant was classy but also a bit casual
4
Visit this place for a relaxing eve with friends . Prefer outdoor seating . Excellent staff smiling and mixing and helping u select food and wine and beer good food , no , it will be nice to say very good food !! They also have a menu for vegetarians !!
3
Trendy restaurant with many business lunch diners. We entered at what we discovered was the lower level, and had to climb many stairs to get to the main restaurant at the promenade level. Food was good, not great, for the price. It was as if they knew they didn't have to try too hard because of the great location. Best part - the fresh bread before the meal and the free cookies after the meal
5
A nice combination of British and Singapore styles. The food is good, but the steak was not of the best quality. Had a brilliant time there as the service was really outstanding and very friendly. Top marks for the service.

Great spot with an excellent ambiance. The lighting and the environment give it a very comfortable and cosy feel. Must book in advance. This place gets very busy.We ordered the tamarind chicken wings- beautiful subtle flavour- lovely! And of course the signature fish and chips and peas. The fish was the best I have ever had (and I come from London) it was so crispy on the outside and melts on the inside and full of the flavour. The peas were not purÃ©ed so added a great texture to the taste. The chips were ok- nothing special.Portion sizes are huge! We had no space for dessert. Bill totalled $150 with a few mocktails.Really enjoyed- you must try the fish.

Visited BSK with a very high expectations and was disappointed not only by the food but by the extremely poor customer service. My friend was served raw baby chicken and the manager stated that the chicken was cooked medium raw ! We were amazed at the answer from the manager. Raw chicken is not acceptable , especially from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The risotto rice was raw which the server explained as "al Dante". We were invited back by BSK management to experience BSK again. However , the restaurant is over priced , the menu lacks depth and customer service is very poor ( as if the customer don't know anything about food in this day and age)
5
Do make reservations, else you would have to wait for quite a while. Environment is vibrant with uplifting soulful music. Tried the pork pie, not what we would have expected but turned out great. Only peeve is that the steak knife could be sharper (BYOK bring your own knife).
5
We had fresh salads with coffee for brunch break in Singapore. Food was very tasty, beautiful overview of Marina Bay and very cool and friendly staff. Definitely would recommend to visit

Wanted to try the famous beef wellington and so I booked a table on Thursday 20/10/16 at 1pm. SERVICE: Upon entering the restaurant, was greeted by the front desk staff and after verification he ushered me to the table which was kinda between 2 groups of people, I saw empty table for 2 near the window, since i was there alone I wanted a more private area and also to enjoy the view of the waterfront while having my lunch and he agreed which was nice although i think he should have just usher me there instead. Service was great as usual with server taking the order/pouring drink and the manager checking if food was fine. MAIN: After settling down, the server check with me the doneness for my wellington and which i replied medium as this is also usually the doneness i preferred for my steak. Was served with complimentary bread and butter, The butter was really good and after 25min came my wellington. The top part of the pastry was crispy but a little soggy at the bottom since I understand the steak was put to rest so the juice from the steak might have result in the sogginess of the pastry which was totally fine with me. Didn't know the beef wellington comes with a side of mashed potato, bacon bits, carrots and some vege. The beef wellington was awesome. DESSERT: It was really filling but I still have room for dessert and had always wanted to try the BSK snickers since I previously tried the apple crumble pie which was excellent. The snickers wasn't too bad as well and best thing is to have dessert and a cup of cappucino. OTHER COMMENT: Can't find anything to fault except maybe some improvement to the beef wellington pre-order form as I believe not many customers would be willing to put down credit card information especially with the CVC code and sending the information online may be risky and not secure. So I went down one week before and pre order it and the lady told me I could leave the credit card details out if I do not want to fill it in which was nice of her but could have just told me when I send the email but maybe I didn't clarify enough so it's okay. Have already been here for 4 times and I believe there will be more to come:) Keep up the good service! Things I would like to try next: BSK burger, fish and chips, shepherd pie and buttermilk pancakes

Totally love some of the dishes like the Pork belly. But one of the biggest miss of the night was the Gordon Ramsay's famous Beef Wellington.Lacking in flavour with the puff pastry falling off way too easy. Doesn't have the same firm crust
3
I have been here many times, I like the atmosphere, the service is on average good and it's good name recognition for when we have overseas guests in an iconic building.What is consistent is the mediocrity of the food, it's good. It not great.What was disappointing on this last visit was they were out of 2 mains and 1 appetiser and this was 1230pm on a Saturday.I had a seafood dish for both entree and main and it did smell when being served, to be fair tasted ok but does tell me not the freshest. I think the sizes of the dishes are inconsistent, my partner and I had the same main and his was considerably bigger than mine.Also a Friend had fish and chips and her serving was huge where as my fish dish was small fine dining size.I had the scallop entree which was nice but a small dish, one of the fish dishes, can't remember which, served with potato, it was ok, skin was not crisped right through but quite fatty, chocolate fondant which was niceAgain food was ok just not great
4
I was very impressed that despite the restaurant being absolutely packed, they had managed to get our table ready within five minutes of our booked timeservice has always been attentive and very cordial herewe were all very pleased with our shared starters, in particular the salads and raw fish platters - we were even happier with our individual main courses, fish and chips (firm and fresh hoki/ling)..my wife and I shared the Irish grass fed steak, which truly was a generous portionthe selection of English cheese was good, offering an interesting variety of types of chees
3
My family and I ordered the pork belly and risotto. The pork belly was overcooked and the skin was hard to chew. The risotto has a nice cheesy flavor but too salty in my opinion. The waiters were not responsive but maybe because it was very packed. The highlight was the wine, i love it
4
Good restaurant with very good food, but not worth the excessive prices. The location is not bad and the place itself is well decorated and cosy. The service is very good. Appreciated it very much despite the prices
4
Visited with family only had a avocado salad but was excellent. For Singapore at a good price would recommend it to anyone having a night out or visiting the theatre
5
We went to Bread Street Kitchen because of the need for a vegetarian menu and a meat menu. Their food was EXCELLENT! I had the black cod, which was cooked perfectly. My date had the veggie menu and she loved the quinoa and the risotto. We also shared the mac & cheese, which had the crumbled garlic on top (never had that before) and that was also fantastic. The service was very good, and the ambiance was very good
5
Staff were very accomodating to fit me in on a busy Sunday afternoon. I was given a seat at a great bar tabe overlooking the water. Service was great, drinks menu was of a very god variety and reasonably priced. I chosse the fish and chips. Huge portion size, fish was beautifully cooked and price reasonable. Great place to just sit, eat, drink and watch the world go by. Well Done
5
Stellar service and very professional. I was dining solo and received my meal very promptly. Staff were efficient and very attentive. The baked trout was perfectly cooked, simple but magificent when done well. Classic Ramsay- would definitely go again :
5
We had a quick lunch in bread kitchen and it was very pleasant, efficient and lovely staff and great quality food. We tried several Gordon Ramsay restaurants and Singapore Bread Kitchen is one of the best in our opinion.
4
This casual eatery by Gordon Ramsay is still buzzing after opening a year. Darkish but not as dark as Cut. Started with half portion of the Caesar salad and it was huge. Ordered the fish and chips for main and I found the batter not that tasty nor well done. My friend also had a tough time with his pork chop which was very tough to cut. Skipped dessert and they gave every table a jar of cookies as petit fours
2
Overall a disappointing experience. Three courses plus 1 bottle of wine cost near $600 Sing. Entrees 2x scallops (good), pate (average) and Seared Salmon (good) were the high point. Mains, Black Cod (small size but tasted ok), burger (medium = raw and stringy but still dripping fat), fish & chips (fish over cooked, batter stodgy, apparently frozen fat chips). 2 mains not available which is poor on a small menu like this. Desserts 2x Fondant chocolate (fair), BSK "Snickers" deconstructed (good), cheesecake w/ blueberry ice cream (poor, bland mousse, no base, non existent blueberry flavour in the ice cream). Nice location, friendly staff, nice decor, however, the food did not generate any real positive discussion amongst the four of us. Overall impression is a really expensive but sadly average bistro lunch, easily bettered by room service at our hotel.
4
Bread street kitchen is a casual dining concept, thought of by possibly the most famous celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay. The food offered is comforting, very much British, as expected from a restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. The signature Fish and Chips was delectable, and the Pork Belly was full of meaty goodness with a thick and juicy layer of fat. Both dishes had meat that was tender, which was pleasing, and the beef carpaccio and tuna tartare are recommended. Go during lunch service, so as to beat the dinner crowd, and I have heard of customers berating their dinner as too much of a slow service. Our lunch amounted to $200 for 2, including 2 cocktails and a chocolate fondant dessert. In my opinion, for the level of service and quality of food, well worth the experience and will come again, if only for their lunch (and a view of Marina Bay)
5
Had the pleasure to eat both a dinner and brunch at BSK this past week. First, I was surprised at the reasonable pricing, thought a signature chef restaurant would be more pricey. The dinner was on my own and at the servers suggestion, I had the chicken caesar and mac and cheese. Both were great and good combination. Liked the boiled egg in the salad. Then went back to brunch with my wife. I had the open-faced omelette and it was outstanding, she had the eggs benedict with spinach, which was also good, but the omelette was better.The service was also excellent. We didn't have a reservation, which I'd advise, but they still accommodated us on the upper level with view. Our server was also very attentive.Definitely will go back again next time I'm in the MBS area

We visited Bread Street Kitchen on our last night in Singapore. We hadn't booked but it was around 8.30pm on a Monday night so we hoped that wouldn't be a problem. We had to wait a little while outside which wasn't an issue and a few tables became free whilst we were waiting so we thought we might be able to have one of those. Unfortunately, despite a couple of those tables remaining free for at least 2 hours after we arrived, we were directed to the bar which was very uncomfortable. After our starters I managed to get us moved to somewhere better but still not to an actual table. They then bought out my main course but apparently "forgot" my husbands (they also didn't ask whether he wanted any sides with it) so they took mine away and we had to wait for his to be made. After we had finished our mains and drinks we sat for around 35-40mins before anyone took our plates, were weren't offered more drinks or to see a dessert menu.I complained to the manager on duty at the time and she was very apologetic and settled the matter to our satisfaction (which is why this review is 'average' and not 'poor'). The food was very good and I think we would have had a better experience if we had booked in advance
4
Brought a visiting friends there and was quite satisfied with the whole dining experience. A little noisy with the open space and loud upbeat music but in general, quite a nice place with fairly tasty food by Gordon Ramsay. Must try the Lamb Shank. One of the best dish I ever had. What a lovely evening with friends.
4
Very nice place. The food and service shows the signature of Gordon Ramsey. Spicy tuna fish tartare delicious. Seared scallops were great. I will not say the same for pastas but they were above the average. This place can always be tried
4
This is my 2nd visit to Bread Street Kitchen.. My first time wasn't memorable (food was fine, service was ok but not outstanding, etc..) but my friends from overseas wanted to go there while they are in town, so I took them there for lunch.This time the service was a whole lot better and the black cod that the waiter recommended me to was delicious. My friend raved about his black angus sirloin steak too. The atmosphere is more of causual chic and can get noisy (may not be ideal for business lunches), but the view is lovely
4
Group of 10 booked for a Thursday night, its was busy, noisy which adds to the overall ambiance The staff were brilliant, help friendly and seem enjoy working thereGood traditional menu, pork belly was delicious and the fish and chips look tasty No point in mentions cost as nothing is cheap in Singapore it I would good value and its a good experience
5
Been to Bread Street a few times and it's always a great experience - good ol' British classics, casual comfortable setting and helpful friendly service. Went for brunch last weekend - the English Breakfast had homemade sausages to die for! Total bill was a reasonable $60 for two of us and we were stuffed! Will definitely be back
5
My family and I just walked in. It took about 10 minutes but it was worth the wait. There are so many options, but I settled with the sunday roast. The meal was absolutely delicious. I definitely will recommend this to those passing by Marina Bay
5
Despite the not so good reviews I came across, decided to give it a try...From the moment I stepped into this chic dining space it was a lovely experience....the food was yummm and the service most of all was excellent....these guys know how to treat their customers well...keep it up ! Will def pop in again next time I'm around :

I was SO excited for my first visit to GR restaurant with High Expectation. For the dinner, We ordered Roasted Black Cod Fish with crushed potatoes, Irish Angus Rib-eye grill, Bluew Crabmeat tagliolini wine parsley, and the 3-in-1 dessert plate. Positive: - the staff was excellent there. Thank you! - Environment and location was Perfect!  - Prices are reasonable - the mashed potato came with the steak was good. steak was good (not  great) - the chocolate fondant was excellent!  - the starter crab tagliolini was good.  Negative: -my cod fish was "OK". nothing to shout about, they grilled it right for the  meat and skin yet the sauce wasn't that good to matched with the fish. it  does taste a bit of ABC Brand dark sauce from indonesia. the crushed  potatoes was tasteless. well i could get that kind of quality everywhere! -Food presentations was "lazy-work". sorry gordon, it's just average even i  got the idea as "Casual dining" ...  -the Complimentary Bread was just Ok. it was warm but again...average.  -3-in-1 dessert as for the ice-creams was terrible. we felt like it was taken  out from 7-eleven cooler.  -Spoon and Fork was placed directly on the table directly without any clothes  and napkin on it where i need to consider the hygiene ... and in the wrong  direction. (casual dining perhaps?)   Overall: will i return? ... mm .. Yes! because its the nearest GR restaurant i could get and i am YOUR FAN! plz dont disappoint me twice

Last minute minute booking, sons 15 birthday, service was great, food even better, overall fantastic night, highly recommend, lived up to experience and reputation!!

Good restaurant at a nice location. Price is okay. Meals are normal proportions and tastes well. Good and friendly service.
5
We were staying in the marina bay sands hotel and couldn't resist when we saw that gordan ramsay had a restaurant nearby. The meal and cocktails were great and the staff were very friendly. I especially loved the snickers dessert. I would highly recommend this restaurant
5
Would highly recommend this place. We were staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel and saw an advert in their lift advertising this restaurant. We asked our pool boy to ring ahead for a reservation. He was told they were fully booked but to send us down anyway and they would accommodate us either at the bar or on the lower level. We were greeted by a lovely lady who sent us downstairs. The waitress Darina looked after us on the lower level for the duration of the night. Her service was excellent. Very attentive, professional but friendly. She is an asset to the team!As for the food...... we started with the parfait accompanied by a glass of bubbles. Lovey way to break in the evening. We both took a sirloin steak for mains which were cooked to perfection, "medium rare". I did order a side of broccoli which were just cooked right, not too soft with a little crunch. My partner ordered a side of mash potato which was so fluffy and smooth!! We ordered half a bottle of red wine, Shiraz which complimented our steaks beautifully .I popped out to the toilet after our mains and on my return, the waitress Darina presented me with a small chocolate brownie which said happy birthday and a candle. Such a lovey touch to a great evening.All in all 10/10 for food and service. Well done guys.I also loved the open plan kitchen :) Keep up the good work, Mr Ramsay would be proud!!!!
4
When here on a whim, not really looking for Euro food. Actually turned out will, nice location, plenty of space between tables, good decor. Staff well trained and friendly, good knowledge of the menu. The food looks to be a selection of traditional British food , but done to a high level of quality and work a Asian twist. A great place for a brit food fix.
5
Have eaten at several restaurants from the Ramsay portfolio across the globe. Always excellent and hit the mark in the market in which they are operating. The restaurant has a great view around Marina Bay Sands. Staff extremely efficient. Comprehensive wine, cocktail list. Food was so good we chose 2 starters and a dessert which did not disappoint. Great night and very impressed by Marina Bay architecture. Book in advance as very popular with locals and tourists alike
5
I've been overly critical of BSK in the past, but my pre F-1 GP experience was fantastic. Every Dish came perfectly prepared including my Irish Angus Rib Eye steak, which has been a major point of contention in my previous visits. The Pork Belly was outstanding as were the Black Cod. The Sides , we great and particularly enjoyed the Mac and Cheese.Service was prompt and attentive, I was critical of service in the past but BSK has certainly elevated their game in that regard. The Bar service top notch and the Bloody Marys are the best I've tasted in SG. .. Off for Brunch This morning and hope they have the Bloody Marys on service :) A new regular spot on our SG resto rotatio

Bread Street Kitchen is located at the Marina Bay Sands shopping area. This restaurant was on the list of must tries for a long time. Obviously the name attached to it is Gordon Ramsay and hence the expectation were really high.The restaurant is on two different floors. We sat on the upper floor where the bar is located on a table overlooking the bay. We ordered a bottle of Riesling along with assorted canapés. The tuna tartare and the other two canapés were absolutely delicious . The main course was Fish and Chips and the Shepherds Pie. The beer batter fish was absolutely English style and mouthwatering.The whole restaurant was buzzing with people and we had a lovely host,Manu who took great care of us

Came here for dinner. There are indoor and outdoor seats. We did a walk-in and were placed near the bar. It is a cool spot to see how cocktails and drinks were made.The ambience is great to chill out. However as we were placed directly under the sound system, the music was slightly late. Had slight difficulty communicating.Ordered a mix grill for two people. Meat lovers will love it. The taste is slightly salty but I guess it will go great if an alcohol is being ordered. We had mashed potato too but on retrospect it was unnecessary because the meat was filling and there was free flow bread too.The service was decent. The staffs occasionally asked if we were fine.The price is on the steep side. Will probably be back to chill, not so much for a meal.

Visited here on a Friday lunchtime, I ordered the fish & chips and my husband had the burger. The fish was lovely, crispy batter & succulent fish. Chips were ok, I've had better & the peas were Luke warm. My husband enjoyed his burger. We both had a beer to accompany our meal but no starter or dessert. The decor is comfortable & the staff attentive & friendly.Overall nothing special and expensive for what it is
5
The food is delicious! From the breads and starters to an extra cookie the house while you settle the bill. We had the famous shepherd's pie. The service made the evening really special. Jenna in particular insured our birthday dinner was a delightful experience. Definitely coming back the next time we are in town

We were celebrating my wife birthday with friends. Great service, wonderful food. I loves the sunflower seeds bun. It was so delicious with the salted butter. Recommended to reserve In sdvance if you gave big party.

Celebrated my 28th birthday at this restaurant. Upon entering, we were greeted by their friendly staffs. Expectations were high because, Gordon Ramsay right?! & boy they did not disappoint. Staff took time to explain their dishes and recommend based on your taste buds. Mock tails were stunning. Based on friend's feedback, restaurant can be super crowded on peak hours. I can imagine as I was there on a weekday, 11am, people were scrolling into the restaurant. Reservation is a must on weekends to avoid disappointment.And ya, did i mention, I had 2 basket of the complementary bread :p. Staff noticed I really enjoyed the bread and they offered to top it up. Definitely worthy of the best restaurant i have been to. Thumbs for the food and service
5
The staff here are very friendly and always checking with you whether is it the food or if you would like to get anything. Had the angus sirloin steak today and the steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It sort of melt in your mouth after the first bite. The apple blueberry pie was worth the try as well
5
This was my first visit to one of GR's more casual restaurants, and my first to one of his restaurants in ages. Frankly, I wasn't sure what I would find, but thought I'd give it a got on a recent visit to Singapore. Apart from chaos at the front door, with a long queue on walk-ins, once seated the experience was fantastic. The food -- top notch. I had the Alaskan King Crab cocktail to start, and the portion of crab was generous. The shepherd's pie was delicious. The apple blackberry crumble a treat. Excellent, attentive service too. GR's team makes sure the place lives up to the guy's reputation, unlike other restaurants with celebrity chefs behind them

We went to celebrate my birthday. We went with high expectations associated with Gordon Ramsay name & were not disappointed. The food was good to great. We had scallops, sea trout, pork belly, beef burger, fish & chips, snickers dessert with popcorn ice cream, chocolate fondant with mint ice cream & dessert wine. Everything was very good, but the pork belly crackle & desserts deserve a special mention. Prices are not cheap, but not exorbitant either. Reasonable for the brand & location. I was touched by the gesture of complimentary birthday cake, with Happy Birthday Mom written on plate with chocolate sauce. The staff & service deserve an extra star. And last but not the least is the wonderful, relaxed atmosphere. No airs about it being a celebrity chef restaurant. Highly recommend BSK for special occasions.

Had lunch at the restaurant with my family, my father wanted to celebrate my 30th bday and mom's 60th as we got united after 3 years... So decided to make the day special and have lunch there.... Well ordered pasta $17 for my daughter, was just penne with tomato sauce, the sauce tasted like tomato from can cooked with some spices to make it taste good.Apart from that i ordered from the set menu, salmon tartare and pasta with mushrooms and POACHED EGG... Felt quite disappointed to be honest... I love salmon tartare and this time, i would say that with all these spices added to the salmon i could not even have the taste of the salmon.The pasta was good, but when it came, i broke through the poached egg, and all i wanted is to see that yolk flowing onto the pasta, but disappointed again it was more of a boiled egg. The pasta had way too much mushroom and sauce thus making it too much and could not even finish... Service was good, attentive but needs more reaction and initiative from waiters, for example without me saying or making them notice, they saw the egg was not poached, they should have excused themselves and take it back to the kitchen to do it again... Hope gordon knows what he is doing... Love watching his programs, but this time i wanted to be a valuable and constructive critique....

We made a reservation for dinner on a weekday to celebrate a special occasion. The day before our dinner, a staff called to confirm our reservation and asked if we were celebrating a birthday. My family member replied that we are celebrating a wedding anniversary.We had requested for seats by the window on the first level. However we were told that window seats were not available for four people, and we were shown to our table with couch seats.For starters, we had the tamarind spiced chicken wings. For our mains, we ordered the fish and chips, the Dingley Dell pork belly and the beef burger.While waiting for our food to be served, complimentary bread sticks, bread and crackers were served. The tamarind spiced chicken wings are not spicy at all, and it is really flavourful.The pork belly is lean with crispy crackling and it is delicious. It is good to share as no doubt it is tasty, you feel 'sick' so it's good to share the calories. The fish and chips is crispy on the outside and big chunks of tasty fish on the inside. All the mains were served with thick cut potatoes. While waiting for the check, we were pleasantly surprised when a dessert was served, with the word 'happy anniversary' inscribed on the plate. There are complimentary cookies at the end of the meal. It is really tasty and I wonder if they sell them.The staff helped to take photos for us. Service is good and the staffs are friendly. The view of the waterfront on the outside is a bonus. At times we had difficulty engaging in a conversation as it is very noisy, something which is beyond the control of the restaurant.Overall we have a great time and we really enjoyed the food

A lovely, chatty lunch with 3 friends, making the most of a lunch special set menu. Restaurant was airy and tables were well spaced by day. Service was impeccable - attentive yet not intrusive. Water glasses were filled often with no prompts. We lingered long after we finished eating, and loved that there was no pressure to leave.No complaints about the fisherman's pie, though should have thought about ordering some veges on the side. The size was perfect for lunch, and reflected the reasonable price of $40++ for 2 courses. 3 of us chose and devoured the Baileys creme brûlée, which was delicious. The cheese and biscuits was not quite as well received - served with sweet thick biscuits, like shortbread. Maybe it's a trend!Would like to return for the a la carte menu for dinner. The extensive wine list looked very tempting too
2
I'm British and a big fan of modern British cooking. But I was not impressed by BSK. The cod seemed to come in a pool of brown mud. The shepherds pie was better, but 45 SGD for shepherds pie! Come on, Gordon's having a laugh...
1
I definitely won't be going back to Bread Street anytime soon. The poor server had more tables than he could handle. The food was extremely slow. Also had to queue for 20-40 minutes with 10 empty tables. Way too over priced for the quality and service. I am extremely disappointed

We stumbled upon this place for a late lunch after struggling to find anywhere that served (or understood) gluten free food. They have a gluten free menu which has a range of dishes, all fairly reasonably priced. They offered bread prior to us ordering drinks/our meal and provided gluten free bread. I had the burger which was nice although a little dry. The chips were good but a little dry again. Instead of a bun for the burger, they served 2 slices of gluten free bread which was a nice touch. We had some Pimms after lunch which was excellent (and attracted the 4 star rating, food alone was 3 star). The staff were friendly and attentive and it was a great atmosphere to sit and have a few drinks (perhaps similar to All Bar One in the UK).

We follow Gordon Ramsay's food shows and tried his SG restaurant. Service was excellent from reservation to seating.We ordered our favourite dishes - Sunday Roast and Shepherd Pie. Food was good. No special twist or surprises though.That must be his intent - we can cook like a celebrity Chef. We will eat at home the
4
Good service and with a great view; the bay puts you in a calm, romantic mood . So the food. Excellent. Except I ordered a steak mid-rare and they sent it out very rare with absolutely no char, just an ugly brown color. I sent it back and it returned cooked just right and with a little more char but, seriously, unless this is a ode to the bad old days of British culinary tradition in the 1980s, don't serve a steak without a crust. But the cook on the scallops was perfect -- as it better be at a GR establishment! Otherwise, pure deliciousness served with a smile. Would not hesitate to return

We went to celebrate my Birthday Lunch ( it was on my itinerary To Do list for S’pore) Excellent location and fantastic food, we ordered Sunday Roast, Special Burger, Cod Fish and some Salad and Drinks.. The food is yummy and well presented. The staff is very friendly and the place has a great vibes. The afternoon turned out even more excited when they got me a surprise piece of pie with Happy Birthday written, the staff came and even sang for me..  (Thank you) / Please ensure to get upstairs as it has the Bay view and loads of Pokemon fans players going Zombies n banging into each other. A Sunday afternoon well spent.
5
Went with a few friends so we got to try a few items; my favourites include the Slow-Roasted Pork Belly (crispy!), and the well-seasoned Seared Scallops. Also, the signature Beef Wellington, (requires pre-order) is definitely a must-try! The Grilled Chicken was a little dry and under-seasoned though, so you might want to give it a miss. Had the Monkey Shoulder Cranachan Cheesecake for dessert which was absolutely satisfying. The ambience at BSK was relaxing & cozy, however if you’re someone who prefers your personal space like I do, it might be a slight turn-off as the seatings are packed quite close to one another. Perhaps the management might want to consider allocating more surrounding space per table. Overall, BSK met up to my expectations, where the food was delicious & value for money, and coupled together with decent service, will definitely recommend

I visited the restaurant on 28th of August for dinner. Ambiance, customer service, attitudes were awesome. Food tasted really nice too. Onion rings were sweet nice juicy, The portion on the platter was also good. Went with 4 Adults
4
I went there, with low expectations, because of all the publicity around Gordon Ramsey but I stayed because of the quality of the food. The service is oriental style. Delicate and with a lot of attentions and we begin by sharing different starters. They were very nice indeed. But the best part was the mixed grilled with a variety of different meats. All of them perfectly cooked. The restaurant has nice and rich wine list. The prices are not very high except if you like to drink
5
Fun restaurant with great staff and vibe. I loved this busy restaurant with buckets of character. Get upstairs and you'll see the thousands of Pokemon players going back and forth like Zombies on the promenade.
5
First impression was negative as nobody acknowledged my entering the premisesstaff talking to each otherAbout to leave, someone came to me and tried to recoup the bad startHe did as i got after that proper friendly and efficient service, although I only ordered an expressoCoffee was very well executed, water service too. Cup design was good taste.Price tag1 expresso SGD 6 + 10% svc charge + 7 % GST = SGD 7,06A little pricey but worth it especially if you don't go to Singapore every day :)I will be back, thank you 
5
Had to give bread st a 5/5 purely because the wait staff were amazing! Honestly the best service ive had. The food was great, but not amazing.
3
Ok, nothing special, but full of people. Well located. Service quite good. Food all in all mediocre, burgers not even that. Good wine list if you specially remember ask for it. Noisy inside. Uncomfortable and narrow tables, beware not to hit your legs to the iron bar underneath the tables.
3
Busted Bread Street Kitchen on a trip back to Singapore. Not sure what the theme of the restaurant is? Food was average. Pork belly was too salty. Fish batter was tasteless. Service was ok. Honestly not sure why it is fully booked other than the name.
5
The restaurant is excellent in every aspect.Food choice is wide, and all plates look tasty and well studied. The Rump Steak I had was perfectly cooked and very good.Service is great. Waiters are very kind and polite and ready to fulfill all your requests in a very short time.Highly recommended
5
Enjoyed BSK so much we ate here twice during our short stay in Singapore! Honestly, after 2 weeks in Asia I made the first reservation when I saw the burger and fries in the advertisement! I needed a good burger!! My daughter and I had the concierge at the Marina Bay Sands Shops make us a reservation with 2 friends. They only had high top tables available when we made the reservation but when we arrived they had a cancellation and we sat in the dining room. Food, service, and atmosphere was so good we returned a couple days later with my husband. We did not have reservations for our second visit, but we could sit immediately at the bar. We all enjoyed burgers on this visit. The guys behind the bar were fun, friendly, and entertaining!! Highly recommend!!!
4
A Gordon Ramsey restaurant quite busy with excellent food, my 16yo daughter and I were reluctantly ushered to the bar to eat. As it turned out we thoroughly enjoyed it, the food was good (but you should have seen my Daughters face when her fish dish arrived raw !! He He) We swapped dishes and all was good, the attentive bar staff kept us quite entertained too, would do it again
5
Visited BSK in early Aug 2016. The entire experience from the time of making the reservation to the time we finished our mean and left the restaurant was fantastic. The reservations team responded to my email promptly and gave us the impression that they were looking forward to us dining there as a result we too were excited about the meal! We tried quite a few dishes (starter, main and desert) between our group of 5 people and every dish we tried was exceptional in taste and as expected was a treat for the eyes as well. The service was fantastic with the wait staff constantly checking to see if we needed anything. Suggest you go for the desert platter if you are in a large group as it is more economical. The prices are those expected of a celebrity chef's restaurant. In my opinion it was money well spent! Would love to go back!
5
Eating out in the Tourist areas of Singapore is not cheap. A pint of beer for £10 is the norm. When compared to other places, the prices here are on a par, however the food is really good, the service is good and its a nice place to eat. It has a lovely setting in the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre and you can get a really good outside view if you are lucky
5
I have always loved Gordon's restaurant food, however this time, we went for drinking only and to my surprise, they also do great drinks! I wasn't able to get the bar tender's name but i saw him in a website that he was one of the finalists in a competition for the best bartender in Singapore...and I'm so honored to share that he is a Filipino! Gordon must be proud of him. Next time, i'll try the food...also i'm scheduled to take lunch at the Hong Kong's Bread Street Kitchen! would love to try all Chef Gordon's restaurant!
5
We went there around 3pm so the restaurant was closed. But the waitress lead us to their bar upstairs and it was so lovely. We ordered some food and my favourite is the spicy tuna and crab pasta. They recommended a cocktail and its really nice :) They will open up the bar area to let some fresh air in and you can enjoy the view by the bay. Its really relaxing. You can also get some pokemons while you're chilling at the bar. >
5
Visited chef Ramsey's restaurant on my first day in Singapore. Always wanted to try food in chef Ramsey's restaurant. We were welcomed with a beautiful smile, the ambience was good and the staff were courteous. We ordered dish of the day, which was pork that day and a duck dish. I have to say, I became a fan of duck that day. That duck just melted in my mouth. That day has been an amazing experience in Singapore. It's the place that you would want to start your trip and believe me it's the place where you would like to end it.

This Gordon Ramsay restaurant is in the Marina Bay Shoppes complex. On two levels. The lower level is within the shoppes and has a stairwell to the upper level, which is bigger and faces the promenade by Marina Bay with great views. Large glass windows and open air areas. Very busy so service can be hit or miss. Food is expensive, but for the area is really not too bad. Two of us each had a beer, appetizer, and entree and the bill was about $170. Food was terrific. Was particularly impressed by the cauliflower salad which had a unique blend of flavors. Cauliflower was sliced very thin, perhaps with a mandolin. Delicious.
5
I came here with my family for the first time. Food was great, service was brilliant, and atmosphere and location great! 10/10, very good value for money
3
Went there for a business lunch while attending a conference at the center. Food was ok, service was good, but nothing that would write home about.Lunch (with desert) cost around SGD 90 per hea
2
The servers are definitely not helpful, and very rigid about meeting customers' needs. I wont go back there. One time is good enough for me
2
Brought a friend for dinner on 19th August for Chef Ramsey's famous beef wellington. Phillipino female staff at entrance enquired if we had reservations and we said no. We arrived quarter to 7pm - the reply she gave me? I can only let you have the table for 1 HOUR sir! Are you serious??We couldn't get to eat beef wellington as yet another Caucasian staff that attended to us said we had to pre-order and book 3 DAYS IN ADVANCE! Chef Ramsey are you really serious? To sum it all up, we didn't enjoy the food we ordered. It was a platter for 2. Nothing to brag about it really and plus our mood was already dampened from the moment we entered the restaurant. very bad ventilation, I am disappointed
5
Really chose here because it was close to the light show and we love Ramsay and the few other of his restaurants we have been too.By reading about here it sounded like a modern cafe, it may be by day but at night it does turn into quite a classy dining spot. We were not quite dressed for here (singlet and shorts) but had no issue getting in. We had a fair few dishes from entrees, mains and desserts. Thinking back I can not fault any and everything was really good. Service was great although would have been great if a tad faster, but that was maybe because we were in a bit of a rush.The price, well it may be cheaper than some other places in the area, but it's still not cheap. Between 3 adults and 1 child our bill was $400, did include a couple wines which at $26 a glass is very pricey!!! But that's one of the cheapest on the menu.Still gets 5 stars from us!
4
Picked this place as my birthday lunch on a weekday - finally I get to try this place :)Set Lunch at $48 for 3-course was very reasonable I must say. Starter - salmon tartine and fried wanton skins. Refreshing, with an interesting contrast. Mains - braised beef cheeks with mash and veg. Abit too salty for me though, but the beef was very tender. My date had a baked salmon pie and not bad too!Desserts - the baileys creme brulee was good! But the cheese platter was a bit too strong for us. Also ordered an extra salad of avocado, watermelon, and pumpkin seeds. Very tasty! Coffee was nice too.We had a view of the river at street level and it was quite nice. Service was attentive and efficient without being overly intrusive. Didn get the WOW i was looking for, but will definitely want to try dinner here next time!
5
The special raspberry and lime margarita cocktails here were perfect on a rainy day. And after traveling around Southeast Asia, this food was a treat! We really enjoyed the flatbread with carmelized onion, straccietella cheese, green asparagus and San Daniele ham. It was a bit of a hunt to find it in the immense Marina Bay Sands mall, but we did it, and it was satisfying
5
The main goal was to try out chef Ramsay's food, knowing that his food concept relies on pretty simple dishes with the use of high quality products and a bit of local flare. The restaurant atmosphere and upscale urban design immediately set up the mood for a good brunch time and waiters provided a simple yet prompt and friendly service. The menu had good selection of each course, including healthy options. We went for a lighter dishes like salads and eggs. Watermelon salad was very refreshing and the main - roasted cod with artichokes and potatoes was soft and tangy. The other two egg dishes were very nice as well; especially the one with poached eggs and avocado on a slice of pumpernickel bread. The juices were also fresh and tasty. One of the cutest things is upon receiving the bill, they place a jar of homemade cookies at your table that were delicious. We were really happy that we ended up having lunch here
5
Advise you to book very popular ,table for two pleasant environment, nice ambience attentive staff wine rather expensive but hey ho ,the fish dinner and duck breast never tasted anything so divine could not fault it, if could go back and back again.!!!
5
Great restaurant within the marina bay shopping mall. A very high standard of food at a fraction of the price. Very helpful and courteous staf
3
Was so excited to try out this restaurant opened by G.Ramsay (my hubby's fav chef). However, we were pretty disappointed with the food. The mains we had were below average standard from what we could get elsewhere at quarter of the price.Interestingly, the complimentary bread basket was very very good.Service was excellent! And the view of the marina bay was awesome
5
Can't fault this restaurant. Excellent service, food and location. It surpassed all of my expectations! Must visit for a meal out in Singapore. Highly recommend.
5
Good location and delightful ambience, with spectacular view over Singapore Marina Bay.We had the scallops, and they are the best I have ever eaten, with the perfect texture and mouthfeel, accompanied by delightful sauce.Beef Wellington was HUGE and enough for three people, with the best veggies and mashed potato ever.Salmon crusted with tasty topping, and accompanied by fresh and succulent asparagus lingers in the memory longtime.Yu

We were at the kitchen for dinner this evening.The restaurant tends to be fully booked on weekends. Call in advance to make reservations. However, you could still walk in. Just that you may have to be contended with the bar counters, which hardly have space for the dishes.Service is good. The service staff tried to make conversation. They were attentive.Food wise, it is mixed. The fish and chip was dry and black cod was just okay.. The pork dish was good. Ale Pie was good.Maybe Gordon Ramsey sells the food, and not the food sells itself...
4
Had a national day celebration lunch with family and friends. We got the long table at the basement level. Note that the restaurant has two levels. If you want view, go for the upper level (level 1).Overall food quality is very good. Nothing is lacking or disappointing. I tried two cold starters -- spicy tuna tartare is excellent! Something I would order again the next time. Chicken liver and foie gras parfait with Earl Grey jelly is nice but not a wow experience.For the main course I ordered beef wellington to share. Not on the menu since this is the National Day special. The beef wellington portion is enough to share for two if you are not a big eater (the meat itself is 160g). Again, this meets the expectation.Overall service is good. Definitely would come back again
2
Missed the first opportunity in trying this famous new restaurant in my last trip to Singapore. Booking a month ahead for this round naturally raised the expectation to very high. I had a great family day at adventure cove so lots of room for great food. We have the long table right next to bar and the entrance. The setting and view are great. Exciting music and smart arrangement. The today's special is a pork t-bone and it wasn't that fantastic. Steak and ale pie is delicious. Red cabbage salad was ok but orange sauce can ruin the taste when it is not chilled. The apple pie was good in terms of right level of sweetness and a great crusty texture. Taste of Mantorla was an interesting dessert drink that I would probably miss.Overall it would have been four stars but I decided not to. This long awaited experience was more or less ruined by the server tonight. The female server probably works hard but absolutely lack of training and EQ. The last thing you want during the course of taking order is to make your customers feel stupid. She has successfully achieved that by responding to the question of "what is your recommendation" with a sigh, turning away to smirk and with a remark of "it is your own personal preference". Later on she came back to ask for the regular 15 mins check and was fumbling when we commented on how fat the pork t-bone was. She was not able to explain or to the feedback to anyone. I have to say I generally make friends with the servers and chefs like in other reports. But this has completely spoiled my night

Too many compliments about Bread Street Kitchen that I'd like to share my experience here. My fiance and I were very excited when we heard Gordon Ramsay was going to open a restaurant in Singapore, we are his fans watching his cooking videos almost daily and this news became a reality to us. Due to his renowned popularity and the intended fine dining establishment, we were expecting to pay a bomb just to get to taste Gordon Ramsay food. But No! The price is definitely reasonable and affordable. Its website is very detailed with food menu and pricing and we could make direct online reservation with special request note on celebrating our 2nd anniversary. On arrival date, we were greeted professionally, guided to our seats, food were served and cleared quickly; overall service was great. It was a fine-dining atmosphere and there is an alfresco bar area could look out to Marina Bay waters. The food were in big portions, nicely done up and decorated. The taste was towards alittle salty but everything was awesome, Chef was able to deliver Gordon Ramsay standard. Every staff was attentive, professional and seen happy working here. We were very impressed of the dining experience. Before we ended the night, Bread Street Kitchen surprised us with a complimentary piece of anniversary cake with ice cream and wished us a Happy anniversary. We felt like royalties in this awesome dining venue. Our only concern was we wondered why a glass of wine could be priced around the same as the cheapest food item in the menu. Personally, we graded Bread Street Kitchen a definite 6-star dining restaurant to visit. I shall return for my fiance birthday soon

First time I came here was with a bunch of girlfriends. We knew that there was no hope in hell of getting a reservation on short notice (the place had just opened then), but we tried anyway. The staff was very accommodating and sat us at the bar, overlooking Marina Bay area. This was perfect as we were just there for some drinks and appetizers. It was a good first experience and I vowed to come back to try the food. Cut to several months later and my partner and I were in Shoppes at Marina Bay. Decided on the spur of the moment to try and see if we could have lunch here. On a weekend. The gods must have been smiling because we were seated straight away. We ordered the Dingly Dell Pork Belly as recommended by our waiter and it was great! The beers we had with it went well with the food, too!Third and fourth time we went, we still didn't make a reservation but were sat in the bar for both occasions, which we didn't really mind, as it was great to sit side by side and people watch while being able to converse. This being Singapore, there are many other great places to have fabulous food and this restaurant is one of them. The food is anchored by British cuisine — I guess, not surprising since it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant — and the food is very very good. Since the first time we've come, we've tried the pork belly, the burgers, the fish and chips and the steak and ale pie (this was delicious, btw! The crust was flaky and light and the gravy and filling were delectable). All were topnotch. My partner, who is British, says that the fish and chips is the best he's had in Singapore. Aside from the food, the service is exemplary. Staff are very well trained, and would come over to the table to inquire how the meal was. The wait for the food was also not that long, considering they get full up on the weekends.Note though, that this is an expensive place to eat at. Not sticker-shock expensive, no. But still, be prepared to fork over around $100-120 for two people for a meal. Still, for a once-in-a-while splurge, it's pretty good
5
Me and my wife rendezvoused here after a bit of shopping for her and a business meeting for me. We were at an outside bench table - superb for people watching! We had some refreshing sav blanc followed by sirloin steaks....the food was perfect, as was the wine, and the view - there's a wonderful vista towards the CBD and it looks amazing as the sun goes down and the lights come on.The waiter was amazing - one of the happiest guys in the world, full of wisdom and he's tall! We fed back all of this to the Manager William - I like to give positive feedback and not just whinge.This place really works at the moment - keep it up
4
2 of us for dinner at Bread Street Singapore...was expecting something mind blowing but didn't find it.Cocktails were uninspiring, lacking the X factor.Food was good but not hugely better than we have found in some good restaurants in New Zealand, not a complete let down but not what we hoped for either. The French Onion soup was the only real standout, a definite must try.Atmosphere was good, but overall a bit bland and missing something to set it apart from everything else
4
Now, let's be clear up front. This is not a budget establishment. But location is good, food delicious and service exemplary. So, on that basis what appears a little pricey is actually good value
5
We are a family of 3 generations and loved the atmosphere in this restaurant, there are food choices for all ages and palette,The chef spent time with my two grandchildren making sundaes and they absolutely loved it.I always wanted to visit one of Gordons restaurants but I'm not a fan of formal dining so this was perfect The staff are very attentive and made our visit enjoyable.We all had a variety of courses and we all enjoyed the food immensely, I particularly enjoyed the risotto which is the best I have ever had
4
we had lunch here - burgers - good food, reasonably priced for SG but the waiter we got lumbered with seemed to either get distracted with other jobs while doing things for us(like getting napkins and tea towels sorted???), meanwhile........could we please have our bill....
4
This restaurant is a very nice place to eat and you can sit by the river also which is an added bonus. The food is definitely high quality but I wouldn't say it was amazing. The price is very high but obviously you are paying for the name rather than the actual food. A good place for a date/anniversary dinner or as a treat. It's quite a romantic setting in the evening and the staff are very attentive and kind
3
We requested a quiet seat location with nice view. They provide us a window seat which can enjoy a marine Bay scenery with nice wine. The Wine advisor will approach u first to help u to choose a suitable wine for your taste. The food is Creative, and the combination is amazing!
2
Disappointing visit, unlike the other Gordon Ramsey restaurant I've dined at. Regrettably, other than the scallops and the handcrafted beer which were delightful, the roasted duck surely wasn't up to GR standards on the day I visited
4
Came with friends, had some drinks upstairs followed by dinner at a very quiet, semi circle table downstairs. The drinks were very well prepared. The food was fantastic, all varied dishes done very well. Big fan of BSK in One New Change, London, and this one has done well.
3
Roast Chicken with bang bang sauce is a refine version of the local chicken rice, Beef in ale stew was mediocre, could be have more impact on the palette.You decide
5
When you go to a famous celebrity's restaurant, they have a lot to live up to. As a family we went for lunch and ordered every item from the set lunch menu including children's meal.We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food , and excellent serviceAlmost disappointed that we didn't hear any of Gordon's famous swearing.Looking forward to going again

I had lunch there with my two boys. The hostess greeted us with a smile and found us a seat right away. My boys had the kids burger and fries, which they loved. The meat was cooked perfectly and was just enough for them ( I wouldn't have minded having that plate myself). I ordered the beef and ale pie. It was delicious. Our food came out at the same time and was hot and fresh. We also ordered a side of onion rings. I have to say these are THE BEST ONION RINGS IN SINGAPORE! You must try if you eat here. We also had the home made lemonade. It was fabulous! This was a very enjoyable experience for us. Our server was attentive and helpful and we didn't have to wait too long or track him down for anything. My littles love it there and always ask to go. We definitely will be going back again and again

I struggled to find a family friendly restaurant with a good view/location in Singapore and fit for a 60th birthday dinner celebration. BSK ticks all the boxes as its a good restaurant, with a good location and is not pretentious like others can be and its family friendly with a separate kids menu. I was really looking forward to this restaurant and the reservations person whom I liaised with on email was quite efficient and friendly. They offered me to book a set menu and the cellar, but I wanted the a little of the bay view as well as to give my family meal options as we all have different tastes. So we settled on a semi-restricted dinner menu which still had loads of variety. The service at the restaurant was great, but I did unfortunately have high expectations for the food. All 9 adults felt that they the food was not flavoursome enough and while good, it just did not meet our expectation of a Gordon Ramsay dinner. I did see a number of Beef Wellingtons being served to other diners, so I assume that this is a good dish there, unfortunately no one on our table ordered that

Food n service is just average. A little disappointed. Service is quite slow even though the restaurant is not ful

Bread Street Kitchen is a kind of casual dining in Marina Bay Sands, they provide very good service, organize, restaurant staff always smile, gravy burger, nice and traditional fish and chips, but fair salad, face to the bay, many people jogging, nice view, but quite dusky, very relaxed environment, vintage with modern, not pricing, Singapore Dollar 250 for 3 persons (including one bottle of wine), very good experience
5
Best meal i had since coming to Singapore. Food was world class, staff was marvelous and what can I say, Gordon Ramsey is my favorite celebrity chef. Kudos to the whole team
4
I ate here for lunch last week . I was lucky to get a seat, although I sat at the bar (at about 1:00pm) , I suggest one make a reservation. The staff was very attentive and ready to explain questions I had about some menu items. All in all, I had a great meal, I delicious tomato tart and a very good beef burger
5
My daughter and I had dinner here.... my daughter is vegan and absolutely loved her meal. After an entree and main we unfortunately had no room for dessert. But will be on my list of must do's for next years visit. To quote my daughter ... delicious
4
We came here on Saturday evening knowing it probably be busy and we tried to make reservation online with no success. We decided to show up at 515pm right when dinner service started and even though at the time there was only two other tables with people eating in the restaurant we were told by the hostess that we can get a table but they would need it back in 1hr 15min. I would have rather left than be rushed through dinner. But I know my girlfriend really wanted to eat here. For me it kind of killed the mood knowing that you are on time restraint. The service was good and food was flavorful and good size portions. I had the burger which was very juicy. My girlfriend had the black cod which was very good. Over all nice experience just didn't like being rushed
2
Stopped here for breakfast on a Saturday morning, ordered a coffee to start, first one was burnt and way too hot had to go inside to get service and they replaced it, still an average coffee, especially for Singapore. Based on the quality of the coffee decided to go elsewhere for breakfast... ordered the bill... 20 dollars for two coffees?? No prices were obvious for coffees so this was a shock..... Gordon Ramsay needs to visit this place and see what they are doing, goes against all the advice he gives people on kitchen nightmares!!
3
Not sure about the concept of a celebrity chef restaurant in a shopping mall. Food was ok, nothing particularly memorable. Had the black cod - just average. Also went for the sticky toffee pudding - a bit dry. Red wine served too cold. Staff and service were fine
5
Yummy T-bone steak, black cod grill and seabass cold starter with very friendly staff combined with a nice ambient
5
I ordered fish and chips and it was one of the best fish and chips I have ever had, also I ordered avocado salad , onion rings , tomatoes and burrata for appetizer none of them was disappointed! I liked this restaurant!
4
Had lunch here mainly because it is Gordon Ramsay's. I ordered an Angus sirloin done medium rare. Got some green veggies to go with it and a glass of pinot noir. It was very good. I don't want to compare this with Wolfgang Puck's CUT (which is excellent; last year I ordered wagyu and kobe so it's different). We just walked in with no reservation that is why we got seated on the lower floor with a mall view - best to reserve so that you can get a table on the upper floor with a view of the Marina and the Fullerton area. The upper floor is the better place to be in for the view
5
completely lovely experience for breakfast. pancakes so light they float!Really beautiful breakfast. I wanted to see if Ramsey's restaurants lived up to his name. You watch the programs. or is that cringe at them at times, but the man lives up to it.Seamless service.Ok it was just breaky, but everone loved the food, kids, parents, & grandma!My only regret was I couldn't go back for a dinner
3
We wee so excited to finally have a taste of one of Ramsay's restaurant. Ambience is great, child friendly, we expected that the food will heavenly good because of "Ramsay" of course. We had pork belly that turns out just okay nothing special, lobster salad that the portion jus so little, burgers just okay will choose BK instead! Fish n chips just okay, but we really love the lamb shank is just so tender and tasty!! Well, i guess having a chain restaurant is really hard to QC.
4
My boyfriend and I went there for a Saturday dinner and did not make any reservation before. We got there around 5PM and the waiting staff by the door told us that we were only be given 1.5hrs to dine as it was already booked. It was quite a mood killer right there. It was not really all that busy at that time of hours. We did not order any appetizer and straight to main course. I had Roasted black cod with crushed potatoes, salted capers, artichoke in lemon-red wine sauce. My boyfriend ordered BSK short rib beef burger with monterey jack cheese , smoked bacon ketchup and chips. I was very happy with the black cod. It was tasty and good. The meat was soft, tender, juicy and the skin was crispy. I can imagine in my head that it was how Ramsay would want the fish to be presented. The sauce was also good, has a bit sweet but kind of sour also. The burger, meanwhile, has juicy and tender patty also. Not so sure where the beef was imported from but it was good. The food was good and the location was nice also. The price, yea, it was pricey but it is because of the location and the name. At first, we were not sure whether it is a fancy or casual restaurant but I can assure you that it is ok to wear shorts to eat here
4
I took myself here while I was on a business trip to Singapore because my fiance loves Gordon Ramsey. I think my expectations were extremely high going in, and I was a little disappointed by parts of the meal. The main I had (the pork belly) was incredible. Perfect cook and great flavor. However, the starter (the roasted veal carpaccio) while good, was nothing to write home about. For $26 I expected a little more. The service on the other hand was great and my overall experience was good
5
We walked in at lunch time without a booking. The restaurant was closing in 1 hour for a private function however we were impressed that the staff were happy to host us in that time. We did notice other patrons being turned away after us.The food was delicious! Can highly recommend the pork belly which is the best pork belly I've had ever! Love the interior and the wait staff were attentive and friendly. A sensational dining experience at a very reasonable price for a celebrity restaurant
4
Environment is good, food is good except the famous chicken wings was a bit too salty. Quite a busy restaurant, u need booking especially if your group is big
5
Well what can only be typical of him simple tasty selections to a well balanced menu flavoursome throughout. Entree of fetta and watermelon salad then lamb shanks and pork cutlet. A bit pricey, hey but it's Singapore
5
My friend had a longing for yorkshire pudding and Bread Street Kitchen's Sunday roast came highly recommended.From the onset of booking the lunch and throughout the meal, I have to say service is excellent, personal and professional.The food was superb. We had the Sunday Roast with yorkshire pudding, cabbage and roasted vegetables; another main of roast pork with apple sauce (the crackling was divine). Dessert was an apple crumble with vanilla custard. And the after lunch coffee was excellent, served with complimentary cookies. Little touches that made the meal special: knowing that it was my friend's birthday (I indicated that it was a special occasion during the booking online), the restaurant offered to put a candle on his pudding when they called to confirm my reservation. When our dessert arrived, there was no candle on the apple crumble. I was disappointed. But lo and behold, the staff came over with a little brownie and lighted candle singing 'Happy Birthday'! That made our day! He was surprised and I was relieved they remembered to do it as I did not remind the staff at all during the meal. Totalky impressed by the high standard of service.Reservations are required and I booked nearly 2 weeks in advance.Be prepared to spend SGD 200.00 for 2 persons for 2 mains, wine, a shared dessert and coffees.

We arrived without a booking on a Saturday night at 8:30 so a table were always going to be difficult to get. We were lucky enough to score an outside table with views over Marina Bay, I can't complain under the circumstances. This was the smoking area but after a drunk woman decided to complain loudly and leave after lighting a cigarette blowing smoke all over our table, we were able to shuffle upwind so this wouldn't happen again. We were both very happy with that. The menu was never going to be cheap, that's ok given the location and Gordon Ramsay naming of the restaurant. The question is, does the eatery live up to the hype? The menu was simple as espoused on many of Ramsay's hit television shows, a simple menu with just a handful of options done right. The wine list was expensive and we chose a Spanish and Portuguese red to wash down our lamb and duck meals. For me, I wasn't impressed with the duck but as I have never really been a huge fan of duck, that probably wasn't unusual and at any rate, it was my partner's meal and not mine. I ordered lamb and while the shanks were out of stock that night, the lamb substitution lived up to expectations.What didn't live up to expectations was the vegetables ordered on the side, we were asked to order side dishes and we ordered exactly what came on our dishes. We don't know the menu and rely on the waiters to advise us, this was an expensive and unnecessary addition that really soured the evening, nobody likes being taken for a ride. Having been involved in hospitality and tourism, I understand what is involved in upselling and maybe we looked like tourists who would only ever visit once. However, in these days of social media, you can't risk that attitude anymore.Would I visit again? The answer is yes, armed with the knowledge that the food is good, the wine list is extensive and the service is reasonably good as we know the system and won't get caught out again with the side dishes
5
Great famous chef food for a reasonable price.Very good cocktails, great service, for sure i'd like to try other plates there
3
A nice space has been created and we were looking forward to enjoying Bread Street however we found the service lacking. It took us a while to get the attention of staff to help us out with our drink and food order and then it became more of a robotic process than a dining experience. Drinks were not served chilled, the food was good however overall the experience was not what we expected. Glad we tried it however it will be a one off
5
Got to have exactly what we where after, it was a great lunch for us both and we wanted two completely different meals
4
Brilliant menu, perfectly presented. Excellent service downstairs after being snubbed at first upstairs as unworthy walk-in
5
At first I tried it because of the name , but later it become an addiction in a 10 day visit to Singapore I went 4 times , I enjoyed the London .... Draft beer with a variety of breads , beer comes in traditional refrigerated jugs , the bar tenders are so friendly and the last night the offered me a shot of becherovka which I liked a lot , really nice place after been fascinated by all the surrounding buildings and the bay front 
5
A Gordon Ramsey restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands. We went for lunch and were happy to get a cold beer and share some appetisers. Unique tamarind glazed chicken wings, cauliflower salad with cajun almonds (all shaved very fine) and a spicy tuna tartare served with deep fried wontons. All were excellent. Service was fast given this was a crowded place
5
Almost didn't bother going due to the mixed reviews but glad we did now. The concept is straight forward fare done well and that's what we got. Excellent scallops and a beef Wellington that the kids wanted in on big time. Desert acceptable but weakest of the dishes. They offer combos on the wine to keep the bill down and the service was great with kids treated nicely but not OTT.
3
I was indeed looking forward to a special treat from Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant in Singapore. The venue is not easy to fund and certainly a long walk from the car drop off point. Nonetheless, we were seated in a prompt manner and the restaurant was not so crowded. However, as 1pm approaches, the place began to fill up and service was noticeably much slower. As we had to turn around back to work, we had to skip dessert and wrapped up the service. While names for meals were fancy, the food was rather ordinary. It looked like a simple burger might be a better approach than the fancy lunch set. I am not sure I would recommend as a lunch venue and not so sure I'll be back soon.
4
Decent prices, excellent view and friendly staff. Loved the spicy tuna and scallop starters. Mains were just mediocre, we had the steak and fish and chips. But for the location and price, nothing to complain.
3
The beef wellington was 80 bucks and was decent. however the pastry was very soggy.Overall, for this to be a Gordon Ramsay restaurant it is very underwhelming and should have impressed more.I would say that the service was good but a little careless.The finishing touch of having some cookies to end my meal was a good idea. but unnecessar
3
Was there the 1st time for a business dinner after hearing about this restaurant. The place is nicely decorated with a picture of Gordon Ramsey. All of us ordered sirlion steak. The decoration is simple and the steak is okay. We had 3 different types of desert and only like apple rhubarb. The service is good but the food is just okay only. The price is okay
4
Been to heddon street kitchen and Petrus in London. Their street kitchen restaurant is more of a casual dining restaurant than fine dining restaurantStarted of with the tomato tarte which was unique and delicious. Had the fish & chips and steak ale pie. IMO the Fish & chips is one of the better ones i had but end of the day is still good ol' deep fried fish & chips..ain't going to be blowing anybody's mind away... The steak ale pie was not bad.Ended with pineapple carpaccio which is really good as pineapple was naturally sweet which makes me wonder if they grilled the pineapple a bit it may taste even better. Finally their cocktails are unique but a little on the pricey side
3
Personally, I am a foodie myself and when I knew this is a restaurant by a Celebrity Chef, so I come with a certain level of expectation. To me, I find the reviews are overrated, probably because of the fame of GR? I find no reason to brag a bout it so I just going to say that the food is way below expectation. The taste is just-like-another-cafe-kitchen nothing to be surprised. No wow factor worth mentioned. Won't even think of coming back for second time, purely because the food and taste isn't that great that I will want to come back. There are more local SG restaurant serve better food than here. I will come back if the other nearby restaurant is full.Was here at 12.30pm for lunch and this place is crowded, we could hardly even talk to each other because it's so noisy
5
I went there with a friend and we tried the signature dishes. The cold (spicy tuna tartare) and hot (scallops) starters recommended by the waitress were divine!My black cod was nice but very small portion. My friend had fish and chips for dinner which I thought was so so. The mojito served looked so different to the usual one but tastes wonderful. The view was nice and the waitresses and waiters were very very friendly and polite. It is a good restaurant for romantic dining albeit that the Resto is a not big.
4
We had lunch on a monday at Bread Street Kitchen. The restaurant is classy designed, typical of Gordon Ramsay's, the waiting staff were friendly and attentive. We had the signature Gordon Ramsay's dishes like seared scallop, veal carppacio, Slow roast Pork Belly. the food was excellent, price slightly on the high side for laymen, but within means of typical business executives
4
Just the two of us for a late lunch and was glad we booked as it was pretty busy, even at 2pm.The Pimms to kick off with was delicious and nicely cold. Have to say though, that the wine was pricey, even by SG standards and to sell bubbles by the glass for $20 and the bottle for $100 isn't really a bargain.We shared 3 appetisers and they were all good. The scallops were amazing and the flatbread with ham and soft cheese just right. We also had the pork and pistachio terrine, which was lovely, though the quail eggs were for some reason doused in a very acrid vinegar. Erck.....The staff were friendly, attentive and discreet and on the whole, I liked the place. Exxy, yes, but what do you expect? It's not only Singapore, it's MBS/tourist magnet area
5
This is a fun place with delicious food and a very special and delicious drink. It's called the Tanggero and it's created by a charming young man named Adonis Reyes. My son and his family enjoyed taking me here several times during my visit to Singapore.
2
The Irish Steak had no sear and was very stringy. Fortunately, it was business expense so not out of pocket. Service was fine. Third and last time ... nothing more than overpriced pub foo
4
My first visit was to go for the fish & chips which I found pretty average but this time I was recommended the pork belly which is nice, juicy with a unique sauce to go with it. Pork Chop was kinda dry though.
3
I suppose expectations are high for a Ramsey restaurant and they weren't really met. We both had fish and while the meals were balanced and the fish perfectly textured both meals were heavy with oil. Not really 'wow', more what you would expect at any competent mid-level restaurant. The staff were professional but a little distant. I had a glass of Giesen sauvignon blanc which I thought was expensive given it is a budget relatively low quality wine. I expected to see more choices of better quality wines by the glass
5
We had a lovely lunch here, with a gorgeous view of the harbour. Our meal was outstanding! We shared a delicious crab pasta dish and we both had the most delicious trout dish we have ever experienced. The wine list is expensive (cheapest 79 Singapore dollars) but we must say the French sav blanc we had was sublime. Mike really looked after us too, totally professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We highly recommend!! The adjoining shopping Centre is also amazing, as is the Marina Bay Shores hotel (and the rooftop bar). The Gardens by the Bay are a short walk away. Make a day of it like we did!
5
Try for lunch on Sunday . Place full of local and expat family . I will go back for lunch for sure is a top place also if you are alone a lot of buzz and atmosphere. The food is a fresh clean and the staff is very professional . The wine list is creative and young with a lot of wines by glass . I didn't try the Sunday brunch or the eggs dishes but I believe they are very popular .I order a la carte and I was very satisfied with my choices . Reccomend !!

Problem with Gordon ramsey is his attitude warrants high expectations since he claims to be so tough and so good- fish and chips was ok flaky but not outstanding- steak tasteless and cod just ok- expected more from a place bearing his name- sorry
5
We love the Gordon Ramsey restaurants and this one was no different then the others in quality or service, but unique in decor and character. Our server would have put a smile even on Gordon's face
5
Service was friendly. Starting bread was nice, especially the pieces with rosemary, but it would have been nicer if they were warmer and softer (if they had come fresh out of the oven).As a family, we ate the Slow-roasted Dingley pork belly, with spiced apple purée; the Roasted sea trout with wild garlic crust, white and green asparagus, white wine velouté; and the Steak and ale pie, potato, mushroom, puff pastry, spatzle. Everyone loved their respective dishes, to the point of thoroughly polishing them!We then shared a Rhubarb-apple crumble pie with vanilla custard as well as a Strawberry eton mess. Also went down well!Everything was a little pricey, but it's to be expected as it is a celebrity chef restaurant
4
We really liked this restaurant it was everything we expected. Some really nice touches, especially for the kids. Great colouring book/menu. Dinner was lovely, interesting flavours and a unique twist on some old favourites and the ambience was nice and relaxed with a cool vibe. Definitely recommend

I'm a big Masterchef and Hell's Kitchen fanatic but I've already read some reviews that BSK is a so-so place. Nonetheless I wanted to go there with my toddler (knowing that if all else fails, he'd eat chips).We arrived without a booking, but since it's only 6:30 I thought we could try our luck. It worked out, I got a nice table that is booked for 7:30, but the lady assured me the service is fast. It was, and I was glad, my son was not done finishing up the crunchy paper-thin crisps and bread that was served before our food arrived. I ordered the 28 dollar burger, which was very reasonably priced. I asked to change the side of chips to onion rings. The burger did not come with much condiments, which means the meat needs to be absolutely delicious. It wasn't. The onion rings were a tad too greasy. After my meal, I felt like my insides were doused in oil and started to feel a bit sick. Even my son, who is normally crazy about chips, didn't eat much of it. On the upside, the restaurant is quite kid friendly. My son had fish and chips and it was $14 only, and we ordered kids' menu banana toffee pudding with ice cream for $8. My total bill was $58, only because I didn't order a drink (and thank god they serve ice water) because drink prices were ridiculous. A glass of wine is at least 20 dollars, and soda and other drinks were more than $10. My son did get to bring home a small memento - coloring books and pencils which was quite nice. I also got some cookies after I paid the bill.I don't mind coming back to try other stuff in the menu, I hope it will be a more pleasant experience. It's a shame that I didn't go with another adult else I would've tried the Father's Day special beef Wellington for 2 pax. Shame, that's the signature dish at Hell's Kitchen.
4
Always wanted to dine at one of Gordon's restaurant. Good experience, glad we ticked it off the list. Good place to relax away from the humidity and heat for a while
5
This is one of my favourite places for afternoon coffee.Very good food and excellent service. I am a coffee lover and here is one of the few place where I can enjoy a good espresso.Recommend it
5
Visited the restaurant during a city break to Singapore for our anniversary. Obviously as the title of the review is a bit of a giveaway we went on Sunday evening. Service from start to finish was excellentWe were seated in a smaller area where the starters were prepared, watching the 3 chefs at work was really interesting.Starters of scallops and the onion soup were both really nice and very tasty.Advice on wine selection was also very good the Pinot noir was delicious We both had the recommended Sunday a Roast which quite frankly was the best Sunday roast we have ever eaten and throughly recommendedDeserts were just as good Not the cheapest restaurant but very very good Bill of $235 Singapore was good value for the 2 of us as the wine was around $90 Will definitely revisit when next in Singapor
2
Been here 8 months ago and I remember the steak we had back then was one of the best steak we ever had. So tender and juicy...After 8 months of waiting we decided to try it again... and failed.We ordered exact same steak, Irish Black Angus 28 days dry aged, and the chef cooked it wrong. We asked medium rare and it came out as medium to medium well. We returned the dish. After 20 min of waiting without main meal, the steak comes back. Still medium but decided to eat it anyway. It literally tasted like cradboard soaked in warm water.... Meat crumbling outside yet so chewey inside. Chicken liver pate was the only good dish we had last night.We'll try our luck at CUT by Wolfgang Puck tonight

We've been a regular since BSK opened and love it so we decided take our friends, who are in Singapore this week, along to experience it themselves. On arrival there was some confusion with our booking and [then] our table was not ready. This wasnâ€™t handled too well and we were ushered to the bar area which is quite small and it was awkward; seven of us standing around waiting (note we were precisely on time and the restaurant was not super busyâ€¦). Once seated there was a delay in getting service in terms of a drink order being taken which ended up being given along with the food order. Compared to our many previous visits the service just wasnâ€™t up to the â€˜normalâ€™ standards BSK themselves have set. All meals arrived together, which is great, and very quickly turned out. However that speed came at a cost in that two hamburgers had to be sent back as they were undercooked. The orders were for â€˜well doneâ€™ and â€˜mediumâ€™ and my guests were none too happy with burgers that were externally seared but raw, cold and bloody in the middle. Worth noting that it was not a case of the order being served on the â€˜rareâ€™ side of well done or medium these were undercooked which purely a case of lack of attention to detail. As my guests pointed out for a hamburger costing $28 youâ€™d expect it to be cooked to order and also â€˜just how hard is it to cook a burgerâ€™? Profuse apologies and new burgers were cooked correctly to order arriving about 15mins later. Unfortunately this did disrupt the gathering and after the fifth â€˜mechanicalâ€™ apology from a swam of ever increasingly senior staff it started to wear a little thin. Itâ€™s a shame when past experience gives you confidence to take a larger group only to have those expectations [literally] undercooked! Hoping this feedback will help BSK keep focus on the basics of service and attention to detail which I have to say on all previous visits has been outstanding

If you are looking for a cheap meat this is not the place.Having said that it is well worth the money. Part of the Gordon Ramsay empire and the food is superb.So good we had to have three courses.Has a good drinks list and if you like Gin suggest you try an Australian Gin "West Winds the Cutless" you shouldn't be disappointed. Extensive wine list.Service was good and attentive.Great night had by our entire part

I made my reservation 3 mths ago to celebrate my husband's birthday. Upon arriving, we were shown to a table by the window. It has a nice view, however, it also has the sun shining directly into my eyes. I requested for a change of seat. It took a while for the waitress to get back to me, stating that they are fully booked and the only table available to changed to needs to be vacant in an hr's time. I wasn't given much choice.We ordered the fish dish for main course and the food took a while to be served (after the starter was served). I was already thinking, how fast do I need to gobble my food in order to return the table back to them on time?!To be fair, the food was reasonably nice. However, the fries from the Fish and Chips were partially soaked in the oil from the fried fish. The dinner ended with a complimentary cake for my husband. That was a nice gesture from the restaurant. And I thank them for that.But will I go back again? I guess not
4
Dropped in today for lunch, nice ambience, casual but good service2 course Set menu & simple pub style food very enjoyable..Looked like all tables around us enjoying the day. Talk about bread overload but I guess that's why it's called 'bread st kitchen'. I think around $90 + a head inc 375ml wine is value given location & Ramsay brand..
4
Great food, good prices, attentive staff, fantastic views and location. The menu isn't massive but it has enough variation to suit everyone's taste. The steaks are to die for, as is the snickers ice cream desert! Highly recommended.

Expected much better for a restaurant own by the strict Gordon Ramsey.Firstly the booking system is a let down, and this is the first impression of the restaurant if you have not previously been. It lets you know that the date is available yet when you book it, it confirms then has a bug on the last pageFront house staff don't seem to be very organised and take forever to find your booking and table.Food was good but desserts were a let down.Perhaps Gordon should make a trip back down to quality check.
4
Had a late lunch on my short visit to Singapore. The pork belly with apple, sliders, original fish and chips. They were all great, beautifully cooked. The cocktail was awesome (forgot the name). Very recommended
5
We love this restaurant .. The food is amazing and guys from the bar . Explain to them what u would like to drink Abd they will prepare the best drinks ... Love it.., also if u sit by the upstairs bar u can get to see the fireworks at 8p

This was our third visit to Bread Street Kitchen and every time the standard of the front of house service has been decreasing.We took friends who were visiting for overseas and were very keen to try it, but in the end we all left feeling very disappointed.When you make a reservation they make it clear that if you are not on time they will only hold the reservation for 15mins. I have no problem with this, however we actually arrived 10mins early and the receptionist seemed completely lost by this. Our table was not ready and there was no space at the bar for us so sit and have a drink so we all left standing in the doorway light lost sheep. They eventually found us a space at the bar so we proceeded order some drinks. My drink and my wife's arrived after a few minutes but our friends did not. I noticed the barman serving us laughing and chatting to two girls sitting just along the bar for us. After several attempts to get his attention with no success my friend walked over to him and asked about his drinks. The barman apologised and said he had forgotten. So he forgot a simple 4 drink order and seem far more interested in chatting up the two girls at the bar, we were not very impressed.Our table was finally ready 10 minutes after the reservation time and we were shown to it. Our server arrived handed us the menus, mutter something completely unintelligible and duly disappeared. We did not see him again for another 10 minutes. When he did return I asked him if we could have some of the bread that they normally provide and it arrived 5 minutes later. He then appeared back after another 5 minutes to take our order. So it took 20 minutes from siting down to having our order. Not impressed again.When our main courses arrived from the kitchen they we placed on a serving stool near our table but under an aircon unit. They sat there for about 3min until I shouted on our server and asked him to serve them, as he had clear not noticed they were there, despite standing a few feet from them. So by the time they served they were luke warm. We just ate them, as it was not worth the hassle of returning them to wait for replacements. My friend made the comment that the server must be working his notice, which about summed it up perfectly. The food as always was excellent and I just can fault it. That was the only plus point to the evening hence the two stars. When we asked for the bill one of the senior front of house staff came over to our table to ask if everything had been ok and we told here that the service had been extremely poor. She did not seem overly concerned, made a half baked insincere apology and duly walked away. As we left the restaurant she looked over to me and drew me a dirty look. I just shook my head and walked out.The chefs and kitchen staff clearly take great pride in the food being served, however they are being seriously let down by the very poor service and attitude by the front of house staff. A very disappointing experience for our friends who had very much look forward to dining there. They will never go back.WilI I go back? I love the food, but probably not, as the service is just not worth having a good dinner and evening ruined when there are many other good restaurants to chose from in Singapore with far better service

We were in the Marina Bay Sands area on Mothers Day and decided to check out Bread Street Kitchen. We didn't have a reservation, and the hostess told us it would be a 1hr wait. We said we were OK with that, but then we were showed straight to a table upstairs.As it was Mothers Day my partner received a free cocktail, which was a nice surprise. Everything about the restaurant was excellent.Food was well presented, well cooked and delicious. Good, not too expensive a wine list, and service was excellent. Not too fussy, but they never disappeared either.This is the first time I've eaten in one of Gordon Ramsey's 'chain' restaurants, but it turned out to be the best meal we had in Singapore

Went here with the family to celebrate son's birthday. The booking form enabled me to add any special requests so had asked for a wee recognition of son's birthday - they brought his dessert with a 'happy birthday' and candle which was nice and he was chuffed! The food was very good and my son had the special of Beef Wellington which he has always wanted to try and especially as this is a Gordon Ramsay signature dish. He wasn't disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed it. The only issue was that it came served on a flat board which although looked lovely meant that if he poured the jus and sauce over the food it would all dribble off onto the table. He ended up having to 'dip' instead which wasn't ideal. I had the risotto which was lovely but, as is often a problem with many restaurants, there were not enough vegetarian choices sadly. Overall a very enjoyable meal and experienc

I visited this restaurant in company with my wife. It is truly excellent. The service was quick, friendly and very efficient.The food was superb. I ordered the rib steak hamburger. Was cooked to perfection with an excellent sauce and chips. The chips themselves were fantastic, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.My wife ordered the pork belly and it was truly amazing. It was melt in the mouth with lovely crispy crackling. Absolute perfection!We finished up with a cranachan cheese cake with blueberry ice cream. Highly unusual but delicious. It was light, fluffy and not as heavy as some other cheesecakes I have eaten.As I have said before, the service was quick (and I mean quick!), friendly and helpful.The atmosphere was great. The restaurant is open onto the harbour itself so you can see the activities on the water and of passersby. In conclusion, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good food and service
5
We arrived early for our table, restuarant was very busy, so sat at the bar,for a drink staff were all very friendly and helpful. Food was very good I had the belly of pork,the others all had steak. All cooked to perfectio
4
Restaurant was very busy when we were there but there was a good buzz about the place. Service was good and menu varied. I particularly enjoyed the cider and onion soup. The duck was slightly less successful as i didn't like the mushroom and kale that came with it. Cookie jar when you paid bill nice touch. They were lovely
5
I was a single person, as my husband was working. The waitress directed me to the table and gave me some magazines to read.I ordered the 3 course set lunch menu, which was filling and tasty. I asked to cancel the dessert as I was too full. This which was not an issue and not charged. The staff were friendly and on waiting for the bill I was given a cookie jar to choose a cookie of my choice:) The location upstairs is also near the waterfront
5
I visited Bread Street Kitchen with my wife on a Saturday morning for breakfast. We were welcomed by a friendly manager who assisted me and my wife to rack our bicycles on the provided racks, which I have not seen anywhere else in Singapur. What a service. We then moved on to the restaurant which provided an incredible nice setting for breakfast. You can mingle along a bar counter facing the Singapore marina and the CBC. What a view. In terms of the dishes served - you are having a small continental buffet option, or a la carte. My wife chose an a la carte dish, and I chose the buffet. The food was of high quality and appealingly presented. I particularly enjoyed the vanilla yoghurt with muesli and berries. The juices were also fresh. Striking was also the friendly staff, everyone was in a good mood enjoying the food and watching people pass by jogging or riding bicycles
5
I had a nice Friday night out with friends in Bread Street after a long week. The food is amazing especially the scallops and pork belly. The scallop has a nice texture and cooked to perfection. The Pork Belly has the crispiest skin and softest meat. These are the real stand outs amongst the things we ordered. What is also commendable are the front desk and waitress who are friendly and know what they are doing.Please note to reserve as this restaurant gets packed especially on fridays and weekends. You can always try your luck by going in early and hope somebody cancels. :

The ambiance and food here is sublime. It's simple but classy. I have been twice and both times very impressed. On one occasion it was my friend's birthday and I mentioned it to the waiter and he organised for a chocolate brownie. I had a similar situation at another restaurants on the other side of the Marina in Singapore and they were less generous. So I was impressed.We were also happily surprised how easy it was to get a table, we called up at 7pm and had a table at 9pm. It was a Thursday but shows it's easy to get in. It's not cheap but not overly expensive for its location and its reputation. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone

We have long wanted to check this place out and the first opportunity we got, we decided to book for a table for two. I also requested for a table with a view when I rang up to book to which the person over the line replied they will try but there is no guarantee. Glad that they did take note and ushered us to a lovely table with a view of the bay.The place was enchantingly dark and tastefully decorated. We ordered the scallops and asparagus as starters. For mains, I went for the cod and my hubby caved in and went for the lamb shank promotion which came with a bottle of Spanish wine. The basket of bread came before the dishes and I must say everything tasted wonderful and fresh. The wine was a good recommendation too.For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant and the banana toffee pudding. Both melted into our mouths. Service was fast and not overbearing. The only thing which I would like to quibble on would be having to put my handbag on the floor. The chair as a hole in at the back and the bag will fall if you are not careful. If you are not planning to change the chair, perhaps get a small basket under the table where ladies can put their belongings safely without worrying. In addition, although there was supposed to be a complimentary parking if you spend above $150, alas we did not get to enjoy that privilege. Nowadays, am sure most would agree that a night out in Singapore is easily that amount or more :-) What happened to us was that we were issued the the complimentary parking ticket by the restaurant but the ticket did not work on the way out. After numerous times of trying to scan the coupon, we gave up as the queue in the car park to get out was building up. Hence, the coupon was of no use to us and we still had to use our cash card to pay for the parking fee. It is a no-no to give your customers expired parking coupons or coupons that don't work. It is likened to an empty promise or a useless benefit.That aside, we would most definitely come back again as we rather enjoy the romantic ambience with its dim lighting and gorgeous view. The food ain't bad too but I hope that they do something about the parking coupons issue which I have just highlighted and also as an added service, the possibility of allowing lady customers to put their bag safely in a clean basket underneath the table

Excellent food... reasonable price and quality service...good location..Long story short... just perfect!!

Having wanted to try this joint since it opened in Singapore, my friend and I finally made reservations for dinner.We got a table by the side of the restaurant facing the waters and landscape which was magnificent. The only drawback is that passers-by will ALWAYS stare at what's on your table.The food was generally good but the prices were hefty. The bread basket is refillable.Appetisers:Alaskan king crab - disappointing as it wasn't very tasty, lacking seasoning almostSeared scallops - while everything on the plate went well together, the tiny pieces just didn't satisfyMains:Butternut squash risotto - the best risotto I've eaten thus far in Singapore!Roasted lamb - bloody good BUT they were so skinny, not worth the priceSides:Coleslaw - the most delicious coleslaw I've had in my lifetime! A must have!Onion rings - beautifully golden and crisp rings! Yum!Desserts:Chocolate fondant - a chocolate lover's perfect end to a meal!BSK chocolate and peanut bar - this is just a different way of presenting a Snickers or Mars bar; not terrible but nothing fantastic eitherWorth a try

Came on a Sunday noon for brunh and the restaurant was packed. We were told we would be seated at the bar and after 15 minutes of waiting time we were showed to a window seat with hot sun shining directly onto. They got decent aircond so well.. It took a while to get the attention of a server and when the food finally came, the omelet was average. Though they did serve amazing Scotch Eggs. Service was slow, no one would refill the water and it was hard to even get someone to hand us the check. The restaurant was considered good in overall but we won't come back again.
3
Pros:- Lovely atmosphere- Manager and staff were pleasant- Bread with butter was excellentCons:- Food was average- Overpriced for a bristoI would recommend to pay a visit at least but will not be back again
4
The eatery is very popular. It is very difficult to get a seat for walk-ins. So reservation is recommended. The food is good but a bit pricey since it belongs to the TV-show chef, Gordon Ramsay. Still worth trying his food. After the meal, you will be served with home made cookies in the jar. If you are not hungry, you still can enjoy the drinks or cocktails there.
2
Lovely location, great view.Food not good, steak pie more pastry than meat.The fish overcooked, overpriced for what you get, definitely not worth it
3
Good food. Well done and with quality, but the prices are high and the wines very high for a "Bistro".Probably Singapore prices, but anyway is expensive for what you get.Nice place to be at night with good compan
3
Lovely location with outdoor seating next to the water with great views and good service. Ideally located if you are going to Gardens by the Bay. Fantastic that they also have bike racks so you can stop by after Cycling.Love that they are open for breakfast at 7.30am at the weekends. This is well priced and there are a range of options.One of our orders was poached eggs on avocado with toast (homemade pumpernickel bread). Delicious and very nicely presented. They were also very helpful in doing an yummy side salad.Sadly, our other order, the Full English Breakfast was disappointing and it didn't feel like it was off the same menu. The poached eggs, sausage, bacon, tomato and mushroom were all cooked perfectly. However, the tinned baked beans and sliced white factory made bread let this meal down. It wouldn't have taken much to elevate this dish to what we would have expected from a Gordon Ramsay establishment. In our opinion, all it needed was some good quality bread (such as the pumpernickel, a sourdough or something more rustic) and maybe some homemade baked beans (check out the homemade baked beans at Common Man Coffee Roasters - a great breakfast spot in Singapore). Not drastic changes but something to make this breakfast a little less ordinary and be closer to the competition. Also worth noting is that the coffee was average. Room for improvement!Bread Street: please keep this early weekend breakfast. It would just be great if you could make a few adjustments. Hope this makes sense. We hope to be back soon!

We went with high expectations, Gordon Ramsay's business being to give failing restaurants advice, but it wasn't quite up to par. The shepherd's pie was quite good, but that was about it - the drinks we ordered were very mediocre and the desserts were very average as well. The ambiance was nice but you would expect a lot more from this establishment
4
I booked the table more than one month before and i stated i preferred table with nice view and sure enough i got it!the service is above average staff is friendly. The complimentary assorted bread is nice with the butter. we finished everything.The salmon ceviche is good and really serves its purpose of "appetiser", the acidity kind of make the enzyme in your mouth and stomach start to secrete.The 380g of ribeyes is a killer, she had it with blue cheese sauce, she told me it was heaven.I was having the dingley dell pork belly with spiced apple puree. the pork belly was done right with crispy skin and soft flesh. the proportion of layers of fat and lean was right too. The slightly sweet apple puree complements the savoury pork well.Mac n cheese is very tasty and i must warn you it is super filling too. the cheese may stick in your stomach for hours.don't bother to order the seasonal green. not with the 10 bucks.one more tip, get your complimentary ticket when you pay your bill. easily save your 20 bucks
5
Have been dining here with my family and friends. Nice egg Benedict and usual main course BSK burger. Have some selection of kids menu and nice dessert. Would recommend to all. Would suggest to make early reservation especially very peak on weekend
4
Went there twice, once lunch once dinner. The food is overall good but I would think lack of a wow factor. I tried their pork chop, pork belly, steak and some other dishesï¼Œoverall nice but I feel lack of the wow dishes that make me want to go back again. I mean I will certainly go there as I do like that place just no particular food craving to lure me back frequently. Overall also a bit expensive.
3
Fish n chips were ok. For the price expecting homemade chips rather bought in frozen. It's those little touches that make it a 3 star not 5 star. Worth a visit.
2
Ordered the steak and ale pie- thinking at $38 it would be sensational! Piece of frozen pastry over a pot of stew. Friend had the fish n chips- fish decent but frozen chips- good service-but suggest GR does a reality show-going round to his own restaurants- showing them how to cook
3
We came here especially because of the Gordon Ramsey name. Unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations at all. The food was under seasoned and under whelming. My scallops entree was tasteless and my partners carpaccio was over cooked. The blackened cod main was bland and gelatinous, the skin was undercooked and slimey. However the duck was really nice and well cooked. Really came for the experience and wouldn't return!
4
This is my second visit to Bread Street and I must say that all the dishes that we have ordered were quite good so far. Especially liked the duck breast that we ordered and the chocolate fondant. Only drawback was that it is always crowded (was there on weekend) and I advise to make your reservations way ahead if you do not want to end up sitting at the bar like we did. We also overheard a party of 6 who had made reservations beforehand were told to sit at the bar area. So please state clearly when you make reservations that you want to be seated at the dining area
4
We stopped here on a whim after walking through the shopping mall. We ordered our meals and cocktails which were delicious. There was a mix up with my order however the staff and service despite this was impeccable. My partner and I have an easy going nature and were understanding of the mix up. From our point of view the staff made up for the error in more ways than one which made our night more enjoyable
4
The place looks casual on the upper and posh on lower floor. The food is okay. Not blowing my mind kind of thing. The ambience is good in the upper floor since we got to sit facing the outdoor
5
Have been going since they opened. Consistent standard of food and service. Just a great place for simple food does very well. Tried just about everything on the menu - all good. Nice also to be recognised 'as we usually' just do a 'walk in' in the late afternoon
4
Had breakfast here overlooking the waterfront. We ordered the omelette along with coffee. Enjoyed the experience and food, but have to say that the service could have been a bit more attentive. The restaurant was not overly busy at the time
3
We were here for a really early dinner (5pm). It was very quiet. We ordered two main courses but what really impressed us was the bread served before the food, and the tomato ketchup served with the fish and chips. The tomato ketchup is a product of "Wilkin & Sons LTD" and I believe it was imported from England

Ate dinner at Gordon Ramsey's Bread Street Kitchen at Marina Bay in Singapore tonight. Started off with a complementary bread basket, delicious bread and we were offered more - not sure whether this would have been chargeable. I had a burger with Monterey Jack cheese which sounded delicious and was very good. The accompanying chips (French fries) were soft and soggy and not nice at all. My friend's Black Cod lived up to expectations. I then had the cheesecake which was whiskey based with blueberry ice cream. It was very good but not exceptional. My friend had the banana sponge pudding which she said was a bit dry. But all in all we enjoyed our meals. We had a glass each of a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc which was good but my friend commented after we had left that her serving was actually smaller than mine. I hadn't noticed. The restaurant is in a nice setting along the waterfront and can be accessed from the outside or from within the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall. One thing to note - the restaurant has no toilets - you have to go outside of the restaurant into the Mall to use the public toilets. A little odd, I thought. Our bill came to $186 SD including service.
5
Salat not fresh, but service was great, lovely place to go after a long day in the sun, enjoyed the various cool fruit drinks. Noticed that other people's food Dit not look apertising, so time for a new chef there
5
So, eating at a Gordon Ramsey outpost in Singapore would seem sadly unimaginative , but, after days of down n dirty hawker markets and seafood restaurants, I just wanted a western meal. Stopped in at 3 for a late lunch, sat at the window bar looking over the bay. Everything from start to finish, to the smallest detail conjured Gordon on one of his shows demanding perfection. Started with a cauliflower salad, amazing subtlety of flavors, hints of spice, and just barely rich enough. Ordered their coconut almond drink, amazing again to the point I siphoned in water from my water glass to make it last longer. Stake and Alex pie for my main. Tender, sublime beef with a perfect crust and that came with a small side of spatzle with more flavor than spatzle has ever had. 5 stars for food, if I'd had a proper res and table I'd give 5..
4
As good as advertised. Love the fish and chips. The burger also excellent. The portions are huge!! The waiter and waitresses are very friendly. Love to comeback here!
2
Booked for lunch with a group of 16 people. At least two of us did not have our drinks orders taken at all, it was very inattentive service. Everyone who ate the pork belly felt ill later in the day. Expect to pay about $50-60 per person for and entrÃ©e and main, add another $20-25 for a drink and a side dish.
3
Was disappointed, expected this to be much better. Simple meals and overpriced. Great vibe, venue and service. Would just go here from some drinks if I was to go again
3
Pros: Fish and Chips was fantastic. Bread basket good. Good choice of wine good, and cocktails looked amazing (we did not partake) Cons: Burger was under cooked, taken back and the next one was slightly more cooked. I eat my steak medium-rare I like my burgers medium...this was still mooing. Only two beers on tap, hubby disappointed.We will go back because other expats that have lived here longer than me love this place...unless the experience is a total disaster I will always give a place another try. Plus I am a massive fan of Gordon Ramsey
5
Came here with my friend to have dinner before we went up the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands to have a drink and check out the view.The food here is cooked to perfection, so full of flavour. Just delicious.The service here is as it should be. Waiters are attentive, came back to the table on several occasions to check on us.I've worked and managed restaurants most of my life, and this is the way I was taught service. Spot on, next time I'm back in Singapore I will definitely come back
5
Me and the Wife picked BSK @ MBS for our 2nd anniversary and it's safe to say that we will definitely be back for moreWe were given a romantic outdoor table overlooking the Bay but had to request for an indoor table coz our 13 month old baby became cranky in the Singapore heat We started with the scallops (9/10) and the tuna tartare (7/10) and chicken Caesar salad for the Wife which she rated 11/10 (believe me if anyone knows Caesar salad it's her) while I had fish and chips (9/10) for main. I have finally found a restaurant with excellent fish and chips after 5 years of trying various places in Singapore . Ended our meal with their chocolate fondant (10/10) which is absolutely to die for plus the resto gave us a nice anniversary surprise dessert which was a really kind gesture I really have to thank Alik and Manu who in my opinion are service champions . The Wife even said that these guys make the restaurant extra special . Alik served with a smile throughout and all her recommendations (wine, chocolate fondant and fish and chips ) were fantastic . Manu was extremely helpful and went the extra mile to ensure that the 3 of us were comfortable including a swift arranging of an indoor table and kept checking on us periodically . You two have set a new benchmark on how restaurant waitresses and managers should be :DThank you for a memorable evening, we will definitely be back :

When I was in London, time and mismatched itineraries meant that I missed out on the opportunity to try out Gordon Ramsey's @breadstkitchen at the original City of London's Bread Street location. So the next best thing would be to savour it at the branch opened at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. I am really digging the British favourite, the Fish & Chips. My new favourite restaurant for my next visit to Singapore
4
Great Sunday roast! Lovely locationCan't fault a thing food lovely we had beef roast lunch followed by a a shareing desert plate for two and also Eton mess and rhubarb and apple crumbleThere were four of us!Staff excellent nothing a problem too themOnly thing we would ask is a little more gravy would defiantly eat here agai
4
Venue: The restaurant is conveniently located in the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Center with a view of the harbor from the 1st floor. In the basement floor, it's open kitchen so you can see the chefs hard at work. The wide angle view with the glass windows doors expanding across the length of the entire restaurant makes it look bigger than it really is. There aren't that many tables, so you should make a reservation to avoid getting turned away at the door.Food: We ordered Sricha Shrimp to start, Black Cod and Rib Eye as 2 main entrees with 2 sides, mac n cheese and mashed potato. The shrimp was so so...didnt taste like anything and the cole slaw that came with it tasted like Bahn Mi, the Vietnamese sandwich. Pass on the shrimp.The 2 mains...black cod and rib eye both were just SPECTACULAR. Black cod was probably the best fish dish that I've had. It just melts in your moth. And the rib eye was just perfectly cooked. Juicy with the right proportion of tenderness and meaty texture.Sides: Both mashed potato and the mac n cheese were both good but nothing to write home about

my friends and I recently visited this very famous GR restaurant. We didn't much have problem reserving for a table (maybe because it's a weekday) in contrast with what other people say. Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us warmly and showed us to our table. She was very polite and nice. We like the vibe and ambience of the place, facing the waterfront of marina bay (good place for date night). Music is nice too. Our server we're very helpful in answering all our questions about the menu. The food came in fast (good thing because we were all hungry). The food is great, being a Gordon Ramsay fan, our expectation for his food is high, but he didn't fail to deliver. The pork belly is the best thing on the menu (highly recommended) and the scallops. The desserts were all fantastic too! Everything in this place is absolutely great, the only disappointment that we have was the asian/malaysian lady in black jacket ( we don't know if that's the manager or what), she lacks the warmth and friendliness that the rest of the staff has. She never smiles and she was frowning the whole time. It's such a disappointment for a nice place like this to hire a staff who lacks the energy and warmth to serve. are we going back? mayb
5
Indoor or outdoor, the views are amazing as the restaurant is located at the edge of the bay. Try the scallops .... One if the best dishes on the menu. Sunday brunch also has an egg Benedict with avocado that can't be beat. RECOMMENDATION: reservation needed! except for very early Sunday, every other time we've been there, if we didn't have a reservation it was an hour wait.
4
I adore Gordon Ramsay and therefore did my husband flew me to Singapore (from Hong Kong) for my birthday this year. We had dinner here. It is great fun. Great view. Great food. Remember this is not an upscale GR resto it is a bistro, therefore menu and prices goes with that. We where given a table too close to the AC, too cold. We asked to be moved, it was a bit tricky for them to sort out, 5 people got involved. However we got a window table, great. Still new the organization was not 100, too many serving you. I like 1 or two people to take care of you. Something to work on. However, all of them where excellent and very nice. We had spicy chicken wings, ab fab. spicy tuna tartar very good, roasted black cod excellent, spicy prawns w mango salsa great. They came to sing and gave me a cake. Looking forward to improvements re staff. I'll be back
4
Overall: Ambience is nice, service is great. But food is slightly overpriced and not tasty. Plus points: Friendly service. I would give 10/10 for their service. Food comes fast, well prepared and nice presentation. The nicest food we ate was the onion soup. It tastes super good. Nice bread and butter and they can cater for gluten free or vegetarian diet. Cool! Makes me happy as I cant eat too much gluten. Ambience is good. not too noisy. Minus points: It was quite hard to make reservation in this restaurant if you plan only 2-3 days in advance. The main course was just OK. Perhaps I expect too high but the taste is not 'tasty' enough. Portion and price ratio is not balanced. I feel the portion is quite small. Beef wellington is not in the menu.Ordered pork belly and baby chicken... But they did not taste that good to me. So a bit disappointed. I have tried other celebrity chef restaurant which I really loved, hence I put higher expectation on BSK for the name of Gordon Ramsay, but I am disappointed.
2
Really, really, REALLY SALTY. My steak was actually CRUNCHY because that is how much salt there is on the meat. I'm not exaggerating. Like oh gosh. I thought maybe it was me being picky, but it can't be because I like my McDonald fries salty. I have given it a 2 rating because the staff were so professional. Or maybe they secretly hate me for being a Chinese hence the additional salt. Hahah kidding. Maybe someone sneezed and the salt shaker went overboard. Idk. Never gone back ever since
3
I dined at B.S.K for lunch with my husband. Food was delicious but it's more the restaurant itself that I didn't overly enjoy.It is marketed as 'sophistication meets casual dining' but I did not get that casual dining / good British pub style feel from it at all.It felt like they were more trying to be an upscale eatery, rather than create a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for guests to enjoy.Saying that the food was very good and we both enjoyed our meals, just a shame the ambiance wasn't as enjoyable
5
Decided to come back for another meal. Ordered a beef wellington and pork chop! Both beautifully cooked and done! Really enjoyed the classic beef Wellington! Succulent and delicious! Had a glass of their sparkling from Kent-uk, 100% Chardonnay- clean, ripe and balance!!
5
Had an excellent night out at this location. Sit at the bar to get a first hand view of excellent cocktail making. The food was excellent and complimented by the casual dining experience and attentive service from the bar staff and manager
2
I had brunch here on a relatively quiet Saturday morning. I was surprised that there were hardly any patrons at around 12pm - most people started trickling in around 1pm+. FOOD:We ordered a total of 4 dishes and 2 non-alcoholic drinks to share between two people. The total bill came up to over S$100. I have to say for this price, the food was incredibly overwhelming. The open face omelette with mushrooms was bland, badly in need of seasoning and uninspiring. Basically a bare omelette sitting on plate. Great. I could have done that at home with tastier results. The scallop appetiser had prettier plating but again, very uninspired and didn't taste particular fresh or succulent. The watermelon-avocado salad was interesting but the balsamic glaze was overwhelmingly tart, and didn't feel balanced with the sweet watermelon flavours. Dessert was the peanut-caramel-chocolate bar (which reminded me of a huge Mars bar). It was actually the only saving grace of the meal with its sticky-sweet gooeyness... but it was let down when served with a side of already-melted coconut sorbet which tasted nothing like coconut and was running all over the plate. I guess it was left sitting on the counter a little too long. Oh, the complimentary bread basket and butter was nice. But that's not saying much is it?Our fruit juices were also very sweet and thick. Not sure if they were really freshly squeezed or from syrups given how thick they were but I didn't bother to ask this time.SERVICE:Unlike many other reviews I've read, I found the service fast, efficient and very friendly. We were served by about 5 different people over our meal but at least they all did what they were supposed to! No complaints.AMBIENCE:Modern New York-style feel, with lots of metals, mirrors and tiles. Would probably be a nice place to go to in the evening for a loud dinner with friends. Overall, very underwhelming food and I expected much better from a 'celebrity chef restaurant'. I would give this a miss and head up to Daniel Blood's "DB Restaurant" instead, which has been consistently good for years
3
My husband and I stayed near here on a trip to Singapore. We were so looking forward to eating at GR Singapore having previously visited the New York restaurant. The restaurant itself and the service was second to none. The complimentary bread and the ambiance was also excellent. The only disappointing aspects were the main course, I ordered the steak and mushroom pie. When it arrived at the table it looked amazing, however when I broke into the pastry I was disappointed to see that there was very little of the actual pie in the dish. The dish was probably under half full with three or four pieces of meat. With the price that comes with this dish, a little more is to be expected. My husband had the burger and had to share half with me as I was still hungry after mine. The burger was good.
1
We dinned 3 days ago and where food vise very disappointed.Tasteless soups and foie gras .Lamb not chewable . Stuff was very friendly and professional. Since it is a British Restaurant.......
4
Overall, the restaurant was above average. We shared a few of the entrees and mains. Tuna tartar was excellent. Scallops were delicious. Had to order the side of mac'n cheese. If you like dessert order the sticky pudding. Typical alcohol prices for Singapore. $25 drinks. $100+ for a bottle of wine. Chocolate chips were good at the end of the night. One thing I disliked was the bathrooms are not in the restaurant. You have to go into the mall area and the lines are long to wait. I waited long enough in the line to go downstairs to other bathrooms which were quite empty.
5
Been dining with my family and friends last week. The food is awesome. Must try the fish and chip, Dingley pork belly. Good ambience too. You will not be disappointed for the second. Lastly, must try their dessert. Nicely prepared. Regards, Michae
5
We went here to celebrate our daughter turning 21. Wow were we glad we did. Service was sensational and food was absolutely fantastic. The entree scallops and also flatbread were delicious, our girls even commented that it was the best flatbread they have had. I had the pork belly and it was a large serve and cooked to perfection. The staff sang happy birthday to our daughter and brought out her cake which also was so yummy. Would highly recommend going here when visiting Singapore
2
Solid beer selection. Had the flatbread and burger. Flatbread was bland and oily. Burger was also very bland and sub par for a "celebrity restaurant". Would not return.
5
Pretty good english food and warmly staff at restaurant. Also they pay attention for children. Children menu and child got chef's hat and colouring books with pens. Price is not the cheapest, but food was excellent.
3
To be honest we went to this restaurant as it is owned by Gordon Ramsey and we wanted to see what it was like. We did not have a booking and it was quite busy but the staff were very accommodating. We were seated on a long " communal" table (by consent) and were waited upon promptly. I choose the Foie Gras as and entree and fish and chips as a main. My lovely wife choose the duck as a main. A little annoyingly the entree and main were served at the same time. Not a train smash but a little odd and disturbing. The waiter did offer to take the mains away but we declined at it would have been a waste of good food. I was a little underwhelmed by the Foie Gras as it was quite bland. The fish and chips where standard fare, the fish quite moist and it came with mushed peas which were nice. My wife thought her duck was excellent, tender and tasty.

Given Gordon Ramsay's reputation as a potty mouth we were hugely disappointed the staff were not using poor quality language or throwing hissy fits.Instead we had very enjoyable burgers, nice cold beers, and were given a good people watching position. The place was competent and we will go back - but it lacked a wow factor - this is often a failing of 'chain' restaurants. The service was a bit slow but you get that in Asia - the region is simply not service minded.There were a couple of screaming brats which spoilt the experience a little but fortunately they disappeared quite soon - why do parents think it is perfectly OK to allow their out-of-control noise machines to howl? I would add the place is vastly superior to my experiences of Jamie Oliver's efforts at Vivo City...........

Had lunch at the BSK Singapore for the first time and left with mixed feelings. Was seated at a nice table with a great view and while service was generally friendly and polite, they had not followed up with my order of the Caesar's Salad with "dressing on the side". The salad arrived fully dressed but i had no regrets after it did, being the most delicious Caesar's Salad ever with light dressing unlike those thick and creamy dressing which prompted the request in the first place. Continued with a fish and chips which had crispy batter and looked gorgeous however there was something off with the taste of the fish which left quite an unpleasant aftertaste. I couldn't make of it and thought it just may have been the smell of the freezer! Nonetheless an overall okay first visit and would return to try out more of their menu. P/s: their sourdough bread is awesome!

Overpriced for the quality of food served, I had beef burger which is one of the recommended dish. I probably made the mistake of having the beef patty in medium rare and the patty just disintegrated. The pork belly was good though and we had a 2nd portion of the bread, served warm and soft. Service was good, would give them a 2nd chance

Celebrated a birthday in this restaurant. Service and quality of meals and drinks excellent. Price very reasonable. The restaurant is on 2 floors with the top floor looking over the bay so be mindful when bookin

After discovering that Singapore had a Gordon Ramsey restaurant it was a must to visit and we were not disappointed. Food was delicious even pleasing a very fussy teenager. We had three courses and for dessert for my youngest was allowed to go and assist in making her own. Great night. We booked in advance and it was very busy, service was fantastic.
5
All of the above and surprisingly not expensive given the Gordon Ramsay association and with it being in one of Singapore's most expensive malls.Went in successive nights on the second one managed to get a table upstairs looking out on to the marina - this is to be highly recommended.If you're in Singapore go here
4
This is our 3rd time to the restaurant. We find that the overall standard has been improving with each visit. The servers are cheerful and polite. The food is great. My children do not get tired of eating the cheeseburger and pasta every time. The onion soup is fabulous! You will not go wrong with fish and chips. The roast pork belly is crispy on the surface and tender beneath. What really stands out is the in-house tomato sauce. Yes, tomato sauce! I never knew tomato sauce can taste so refreshing and smooth. Onion rings and fries go very well with it. We love this place
5
We went here for dinner, walkin and got a table immediately. The size of the meals was huge. Quality, top notch and tasted superb. The pork belly melted in the mouth and the jus was pan juices from heaven. Thanks gordon ramsay for a fab night

We wanted to celebrate our daughter's good results for her A Level exams and she chose BSK. We wanted to have Sunday lunch there are tried to book about 10 days in advance. We found that the earliest a table on the upper level (with bay view) was available was 2:15pm! We arrived punctually not wanting to lose our table! We were not disappointed. We were given a comfortable table with an excellent view. The menu offered a good range of contemporary British cuisine and a good selection of house specials, including traditional English Sunday Roast. The beverage list was equally complete and will satisfy any kind of thirst. We ordered a selection of traditional favorites, including steak & eggs, fish & chips, grilled black cod and cheese burger. We received most of our food within 15 minutes, although for some reason, the fish & chips came almost 10 minutes after the rest. We suspect someone missed something. The taste and quality of the food was good enough for us to overlook the late arrival of the fish & chips. Portions were generous but not too large. The crowd thinned out at 3pm and we received more attention from the service staff then. They were helpful with dessert recommendations without being pushy. Overall, it was a worthwhile visit and we look forward to another visit to try the Sunday Roast and other dishes. Thank you, Gordon Ramsey

Very good location near marina bay sand hotelGood serviceFor vegetarians it is better to know in this restaurant you have special menuPerfect sauces All dishes was fantasti

We loved our meal at Bread Street Kitchen. The staff were lovely and very accommodating of our needs, the cocktails were delicious and the food reminded me of home. The bread basket had a good variety and we devoured it (then ordered a second!). For starters I recommend the grilled scallops; for mains you can't go wrong with their delicious shepherds pie - it has a beautiful potato and garlic brioche crust with a piping hot lamb and veggie filling. My friends also enjoyed the pork pie (special of the day) and the burger.The portions are pretty good and honestly I could not finish my pie. Next time I'm skipping starters and going to try some dessert. Book a table in advance
5
Bread street kitchen is AMAZING. The entire crew working at BSK are extremely friendly, prompt and most of all it feels like a family. The food is good and the prices aren't unaffordable. Would highly recommend anyone to head there for drinks or dinner. And try the signature cocktail Tanggero made by Barcardi Legacy finalist Adonis Reyes.

friendly and tasty menu with equally friendly service on prime location, choice of seating settings
4
There is quite good food but we wait more from Ramsay's restaurant. Nothing was untasty but nothing was delicious. Price is very high
4
The basket of bread alone is amazing! Think I asked for 2 or more refill until I can no longer take another bite. And since it was the first time for me and my husband to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, we got a little too excited and ordered more than what we can chew.We went on a Sunday during lunch and they were serving their Sunday Brunch Menu and below are the list of what we have ordered:The English BreakfastRisotto with roasted Jerusalem artichoke, aged parmesaTraditional fish & chips, crushed peas and tartar sauceOnion RingsMonkey Shoulder Cranachan cheesecake, mulled berriesThe overall quality of the food is average. What stood out for me was the Risotto and the cheesecake. I would highly recommend it for special occasions as the price is quite costly. It is a twice in a year affair kind of restaurant for me.
3
BSK started off well enough and I had the standard burger. Simple, well executed. But over the next 3 months, the execution and quality just dropped off the cliff. Very disappointing. Mains were also well executed and tasteful, but sizes very small (can imagine the rent must be a killer - MBS needs to re-assess how it's charging rents)
5
Decided to drop by for late dinner! We were promptly lead to the bar for a quick drink while they arrange a table for us! Decided to eat at the bar! Had a Austrian white and German white, both great quality, the starter was nicely done, main - the pork belly was the star- succulent and crispy! The sommelier recommended a natural Pinot from Adelaide hills- interestin

Walked in on Friday night ,got a good table ,friendly staff, our meals were well presented, quick time, plenty and wow I cant remember ever having a better Pork Belly dish, my wife had the Fish and Chips it was tasty and plentiful, we both had desert again it did not disapoint. The drinks are a bit $$Expensive but well worth eating here, we are going back for our last night in Singapor

We really enjoy Gordan Ramsey and his TV shows. We booked this restaurant because of that. A few things disappointed us, firstly the front door reception seemed really arrogant and we were just about to spend our money in the restaurant and she made us feel uncomfortable. Secondly the quantity of food was lacking, whilst the food quality was amazing we left feeling hungry, so people are aware we are not massive people looking to eat heaps quite the opposite.So to sum up the food is great, service needs improving to represent Gordan's name better and quantity needs to increase. Hopefully management read this to improve, I had the Shephard's pie but maybe needs some side vegetables. Just an example
2
Dear Mr. Ramsey, I am totally aware that you are far too busy doing TV shows and other publicity events to be able to quality control the restaurants, that are running under your name. But in the long run it might affect a brand when the quality delivered is far less than promised. I will probably never go back to a Bread Street Kitchen in whatever country. Reason is the underwhelming experience in just made in Singapore. Starting with a rather poor door service. We were sat on the bar with the promise to get a table as soon as there is a vacancy. But we were forgotten and only after several reminders we finally got a table. Apologies: zero. The service stayed bad all way through dinner. Cocktail was taken away before finished, main course arrived very late, side dishes were not delivered at all and we had to remind. Again no apologies from the service people at all. Culminating in our credit card taken as we wanted to pay and not returned for 10 minutes without any explanation. All in all our worst experience in 4 days Singapore and that on a rather high end cost scale. Very disappointing
5
Visited on our last night in Singapore - excellent quality, super friendly service. You would not expect it to be cheap, but we thought for Gordon Ramsay it was competitively priced. Would warmly recommend. I had the best belly pork ever tasted, delightfully cooked & presented
4
Went for the Valentine's Day set menu which was priced quite high in comparison to the meal i had at Cut by Wolfgang Puck (it actually worked out cheaper than this place). The staff were very pleasant and friendly, however the food by any means was not spectacular. The starters were comparable to any other fine dining experience and the main being the beef wellington wasn't cooked as well as say my local pub down the street. I did the find the desserts the highlight of the night, the chocolate fondant and cheesecake were to die for. A great meal, but for the price, next time i might have second thoughts
4
Dropped by BSK for brunch last weekend. Was definitely not disappointed.For starters we got the salmon ceviche which was extremely refreshing. We then got the seared scallops. Scallops was nice and firm without being too chewy. Definitely a must.The flatbread however was pretty underwhelming. For our mains we got the pancakes. Super fluffy and delightfully delicious. The caramelised bananas on top was the cherry on the cake. We also got the avocado on toast was pretty good as well
5
I had a watermelon & feta salad. My hubby had beef burger with large fries as we did not want a large meal!This was perfect size & delicious!Service was the best we experienced in Singapore
4
We held our office Christmas lunch at your private room and had drinks upstairs thereafter. Your service is excellent and your staff are very attentive. I love how creative your cocktails are, very good

We went as a family for a Sunday night dinner. No reservations , we walked in and they seated us outdoors at bar styled seating. The place itself was wonderful and the view was great. Lets Start with the Good ;Service staff was very attentive, friendly and accommodating. Their tamarind chicken was amazingly good.The bread basket was tasty and Food arrived promptly .And here is where it gets confusing, some of their main dishes were great and other were below average. Their trout was amazing but their fish and chips were bland , and honestly I've had much better for less than half the price. Also one of our fish and chips arrived slightly raw on the inside. Which was a weird slip-up.Their main courses were on the smaller side. And on a design note it was really odd that their menu used a font that looked and felt similar to comic sans, which is weird choice that didnt go with the whole feel of the place, and seemed at odds with their original logo and branding.Overall we've honestly experienced much better places for the same price range. Though they do have some good things going for it (try their wings, loved their squashed peas and they have yummy ketchup) , they still left much to be desired (serving undercooked raw food, small portions , and some dishes were just not that great). My mother who has been to their bread street kitchen in UK says its just really not that great here. Shame as I am a fan of Gordan Ramsay.If you are looking for a good meal,MBS has MUCH MUCH better choices, for the same price. Doubt I will visit again

We ate here for lunch on our last day in Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed it. The bread basket was great, and had a lovely selection. My husband had the fish and chips and I had the burger, both of which were excellent. The chips were fantastic, and they had malt vinegar! We also had a side of onion rings that were delicious. My husband loved the British tomato ketchup that came with our meals, so much so, I'm trying to source it in Australia. The staff we dealt with were all lovely and helpful. Other posts have mentioned the price, and while yes, it may be considered a bit pricey, it is in the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes, so shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Our meal came to around $100 - two mains, a side, bottled water and two soft drinks. We didn't think this was too bad considering we paid the same for lunch (much less satisfying) at the Superheros Cafe in MBS
5
Excellent Food , service very good as expected, staffs were friendly and food were served very promptly although restaurant was full and there were people waiting . No regret , great all round. Love the pork chop
4
I have been already 3 times. I believe Singaporeans think that Gordon Ramsay only cooks 3 stars menus, but I think that a great chef can be only such when can cook also simple dishes! I love the fact that you can eat pub food but of the highest quality, in a nice environment and with great drinks. My favourites are the baby chicken and the lamb chops
2
This is essentially British pub food at about 3 times the price in a fancy setting. The drinks are also very pricey. Food was tasty enough but the service was disappointing. Unfortunately as is so common in Singapore there is a clear lack of training or direction. Just allocate one wait staff to each table, have them take the orders and remember who ordered what. It's not that hard! We were a table of 8 and the wait staff consistently delivered the food and drinks to the wrong person. Drinks service was also very slow. Unfortunately when it's such poor value I won't be returning
2
"British" style food was below pub average and the service was pretty bad as well. I'm pretty sure they gave me the wrong wine but then argued with me that I was mistaken... Why not just bring the bottle when pouring the glasses? Took a long time for them to bring drinks. Quite disappointing though we had a nice time because of the good company :)
5
Fantastic location. We got there much in advance and the staff were very helpful in getting us a table eventhough it was a Saturday night running full capacity. Good selection of wines. Food was well prepared and the Lemon Meringue pie was out of this world! Service was excellent.
3
We had brunch here on a weekend. Their fresh juices are lovely and so is the cappucino, their fries are perfect and their hollandaise poached eggs are very well done. The reason why I give 3 stars is because the staff is constantly at your table:They were/are not very sly about it, therefore making conversation awkward, I appreciate my glass getting refilled but between new cutlery, drinks arriving at separate times, bread being replenished, butter being replenished, glasses being filled I felt like a tourist attraction. I do not feel the staff here co-ordinate well either because out of all the fine dining restaurants I have attended I hardly ever notice waiters and they are rarely on your table.. I don't think anybody needs or wants 4 different waiters to slave away 20 times backwards and forwards to our little table.2) I feel that this venue does not represent Gordon Ramsay's talents at all, it has a franchise feel to it not so much fine dining. For the experience, it was overpriced. In terms of the chefs, no complaint perfect food. If you don't mind the attention I would recommend. All I am saying it was 2 of us so imagine if it was a bigger table..
5
Only positives to say about this place! A wonderful staff member was able to fit us in for lunch (in spite of not having a reservation) and the waiters / waitresses were attentive but not disruptive. Bread was great and plentiful. I had the shepard's pie and my partner had the steak and both were deeeeelicious! I'd certainly go again
1
Oh Mr Ramsey, we had lunch here today and were very let down, first ordered drinks, unfortunately what we ordered (cider) had not been delivered today, then my wife ordered fish and chips with chunky chips, when our meal arrived my wife was informed that they had no chunky chips and so had used frozen skinny fries as my wife started her meal the chips were cold so food sent back which left me eating on my own, a free coffee was offered which was declined, all in all very poor standard service from a restaurant bearing Gordon Ramsey's nam
5
We popped in without a reservation, but they found us a seat at the bar. You are presented with a basket of complimentary breads that was just incredible, overall the food was amazing, the staff helpful and attentive. I will be looking for their London branch and visiting again very soon!

I hope Gordon Ramsey Group is listening. Gordon has achieved the status of a celebrity, has achieved innumerable Michelin stars. On Television shows he has highlighted how important service is irrespective of how good the product is(food) or the chefs creativity, consistency in the kitchen and so he should take this feedback seriously and proudly. One can understand that the temperature of the food is right 2 times 3times 10 times even. That the butter or the meat or the avocado is consistent those many times. But what do you do for the human element called service. Even celebrity stars who are paid to smile have not achieved consistency in smiling and at the lower end of the system in hospitality to achieve the consistency of genuine smile and impeccable warm and efficient service is very difficult with long hours and stretching your facial muscles continuously. I cannot overlook the food consistency because of my very restrictive diet and neither can I overlook service. I can at times overlook the food but not service. I have gone atleast 70 times if not more to Bread Street Kitchen. The first time that I went was because it was "Gordon Ramsey" name signifying that there would be quality but now I go because of the consistent service of not 1 person but of an entire team - Eliza, John, Allie, Jenna, Manu, Mike and Chef Sabrina. who see to it that the group philosophy as well as customer satisfaction that too with a challenging customer which is very difficult to do consistently but which they have achieved should be highlighted as benchmark standards of excellence
5
If you are a gordon ramsay fan, you should try this when you have the time. The place is always crowded at night, so its better to reserve the place ahead of time. Going to visit this place again the next time i am back in singapore to try the famous gordon ramsay's beef wellingto
5
The foods are delicious w nice selection of wine. Located on the top floor of Mbs shopping mall. At night time the 2nd floor seating is nice as you can see the view across fullerton hotel. A good place for relaxing too

I was looking forwared to a visit to Bread Street Kitchen having eaten before at other Gorden Ramsey Restaurants , I am a real fan of his. Bread Street however is not quite the gastronimic delight that his other ventures are . However neither does it hold the same acolades as the others so one has to know what to expect, We just rocked up and asked for a table. and got one within two mins. We ordered beer which comes in pewter tankards which have been chilled. I thought a fantastic touch . We were asked by three different waiters within a two minute period if we were ready to order. Not so good and starting to feel hurried at this point . Decided to go simple on the choice and ordered fish and chips. Said food arrived farily promptly and was of good quality .Nothing overly special but nothing to complain about either. We actualy ended up here twice in one week but that was due to location and not because the food was off the charts good . Its quite difficult to sum up Bread Street Kitchen really. In one word beige . Really you could be in any midrange restaurant .
3
Went for lunch with friends and was told that this was a Gordon Ramsey restaurant - that sort of bumped up my expectations. We liked most of the food but I thought the portions were small (thought pricing was OK for Singapore standards). It was full house during our visit but service was decent
4
It does what it says on the tin.You sit in a premium spot up the top part of the bar and get a great view across the bay. The food is relatively expensive but has to be expected for the venue.Staff are friendly and the beer is served in great old school goblets
3
Had lunch at Bread Street Kitchen at MBS and I would start by saying it's a nice set up and the waitresses are very helpful and attentive. What I was really here for though was Gordon Ramsay's food having seen so much of him on television. As foul mouth as he is, my family and I absolutely love him whether it's kitchen nightmares, Mastercard US or Junior Masterchef. We ordered the veal carpaccio for starters and the beef short ribs burger and shepherds pie for mains. While the veal was nice and refreshing, the burger and Shepherds pie were really ordinary. It was overall a nice lunch outing but I honestly expected a bit more from a Gordon Ramsay joint. Would return to try the famous beef Wellington as posted by others.
5
I went there on my own for a drink and I got a bit to eat (sushi). The staff was very nice and attentive. An attractive busy enviroment for a Tuesday. All in all nice early evening experience. Thank you bread street kitchen :
3
My second time here and I tried the famous beef Wellington. The beef was tender but not salty enough. And the buff pasty, while crispy was not embellished with the same patterns that Gordon ramsay creates.
4
I like bread street. We have been to one in London and Hong Kong and it's always buzzing. Food is always good as is the service. The same goes for their Singapore branch.
3
We tried Bread Street Kitchen for a Sunday Brunch. The flat white coffee I ordered was very good as was the service. Our meals were served very promptly and the waiter was friendly and efficient.We ordered the Eggs Ben, Pancakes and the English breakfast. Whilst the Eggs Ben was good, it was very uneventful, no different to what you would get in a cheap cafe in Singapore. The Pancakes were nice. The English breakfast was good, however I would have expected much more from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. It was no different to the quality of an English Breakfast that you would get in any suburban corner cafe in Sydney. The biggest let down was the bread in the English Breakfast, it was your normal sliced bread from Cold Storage. Given the name of the restaurant we were expecting Gourmet bread, unfortunately that was not the case. Overall we had a good experience but were now wowed
4
Visited here but there is no sign of this being associated with Gordon Ramsey as far as I could see.A bit pricey, I had the lamb chops which you can have as a surf and turf, so ordered with lobster. The food was good and service was attentive, the place is pricey but in line with this sort of establishment.Atmosphere was nice and being next to the bay and the shops had a nice locatio

My husband and I enjoyed dinner and drinks overlooking the bayside and the fireworks (Chinese new year) in this restaurant. I had the best risotto and my husband had himself an OK burger - nothing extraordinary (whereas I really enjoyed the risotto).Drinks were good and strong, I recommend the Aviator, not sweet and sticky at all, and the bread was good and plenty - take it from a Dane who is used to eating bread of the best quality every day. And the butter that came with the bread was salted! Yay, that added a lot to the taste of the bread as well. Thumbs up for the bread and the cocktails (and the risotto).The prices are a bit high - we wouldn't go there and have a three course meal. On the other hand, the view, the location and the staff attendance was great
4
We had dinner on the evening of Feb 13th @ 2045.Service and welcome - Right up there with other GR joins in the UK. Pleasant, well turned-out and groomed, smiley and professional. Aperitifs - I had a vodka martini and my date Prince of Julep (?) - both were very good, no complaints. The PoJ was very interesting and if you like cardamom and bitters I would seriously recommend it!Food - we had the BSK meat/cold cuts platter to start followed by black cod for my date and the artichoke risotto for me, and the Monkey Shoulder (whiskey) infused cheesecake to share for desert. The food was quite simply put - Excellent - in particular the risotto remained a perfect consistency from start to finish (and I am not a quick eater) which is something that is not easily accomplished. The cheesecake IMO could have been a little more Monkey Shouldery - but then we do like our whiskey.Wine - the only negative, eye-wateringly expensive - we had a bottle on the lower end of the price range (a well known Lebanese red - the Chateau Musar Hochar 2009) and it more than doubled our bill for the evening. Whilst one gets accustomed to this (tragically) in Singapore and in particular in prime locations such as Orchard Rd, Dempsey HIll and MBS - I still believe that restaurants can do better on this. This sort of mark-up (250-300%) is no longer a question of import taxes, duties or storage. We love our wine and would almost always have a 2nd bottle on any nice dinner out - but not for silly money. Verdict - I'd certainly come back for the food and the cocktails but will have to think hard about wine options. But for the cost of wine - BSK would have received a "Good" on the "Value for Money" criteria, as a result I've given it an "Average"

We were at this place for an early dinner. We were allowed to sit at high chairs next to each other at our request with a great view over the bay. The atmosphere and the interior is very nice, I haven't seen anything similar in Singapore. The menu is simple, I know it's supposed to be a bistro and not a Michelin restaurant but still- fish and chips...We ordered each a starter (scallops, shrimps) and a main course (sea trout, steak). As most write here, appetisers were great, main courses lack the taste, my trout was basically tasteless and my husband's stake arrived well- done instead of medium, after complaint was changed without a problem, though the manager tried to justify it with 'different cultures, different tastes', but well-done can't be 'medium' in a any culture. Service was very good. In one word, the visit was good and nothing else. Maybe it's the name of Mr Ramsay makes us be more demanding to the place but for me the place is just one of many except for its nice location and atmosphere
3
Made a wrong reservation online and lady who answered call (and confirmation call on day of reservation) was polite. Upon arrival for lunch, we were greeted warmly and ushered to a lovely window seat with a view of the waterfront. As we were dining with our toddler, he was given a kids colouring pack and menu. We ordered the following:- Complimentary bread basket (very good - fresh and tasty)- Kid's tomato soup (very good - creamy and slightly sweet for kids)- Cold appetiser Beef Brisket (good - nicely paired with the chutney)- Shepard's pie (average - had better pies elsewhere)- Fish and Chips (average - fish was over fried, chips was normal. No vinegar given)Overall, good bread and kids soup but others I wouldn't put a GR tag on them. Food is slightly on the salty side but we like our food tasty (saltier) so that was not a problem. We spent S$110 on a meal for 2 without drinks.

We ate here four nights ago and had such a wonderful meal that we tried it again to celebrate Valentine's Day and our last night in Singapore. Though I had just finished my main course, the waitstaff asked whether they could clear my plate. However, this was before my partner was even three-quarters finished his meal so I politely replied, "Would you mind waiting until my guest has finished, please?" Without waiting a beat, the waitstaff then asked, "Can I bring you a menu so that you can order dessert?" to which I again had to ask, "Could we wait until he has finished?" pointing to the fact that he was still eating.We had not dawdled through dinner. If fact, we had only been at the restaurant about twenty-five minutes by this time. This entire interaction clearly emphasized to us that our business (especially our repeat business) was of no value to them and that it was more important to turn over our place at the bar (not even a table) than provide any reasonable customer service. Though the manager offered his apology, the damage had been done and we opted to go somewhere where our business would be appreciated and we could enjoy ourselves.Ultimately, the food was good but the customer service was offensive. What's criminal is that the 10% service charge is automatic and cannot be declined.Please think twice before spending your hard-earned money at this expensive restaurant
5
I finally got to try the famous Beef Wellington and Im not disappointed. Everything about this place was good, the ambience, service, food and specially the drinks!
4
Great food and very friendly service. We ordered Sirloin steak, fish and chips, baby chicken and everything was very nice. Will be back again for sure
3
Having dined in another British celebrity chefs restaurant several times in Sydney the wife and I were disappointed with the quality of the mains for the price. ( It wasn't bad and if we were dining at the local bowling club/ pub we would have been happy). The location at the Marina Bay Shoppes means the view of the city was fantastic, the waitstaff were excellent and the complimentary breads and butter were delicious. Be aware that to make the main course feel complete you need to order sides as ordering a $38 Pork Belly means that you get 2 strips and some sauce on a plate. The onion rings we had as a side were really good but the fancy little jar of tomato sauce that comes with it I am fairly sure is the same recipe as Heinz Ketchup
4
Very cheerful and friendly service all round.Great food, especially their excellent bread and generous butter that came with our order of tuna tartare. The sausage roll was very well plated/ presented too.Reasonable prices
5
Came here during the first few weeks of opening and we had a wonderful meal, great views of the marina and even the SG50 fireworks, we were impressed by the food, service and ambience. Came back in February (left it too long) and the service has really stepped up a gear, so many attentive staff, all with very specific roles, as you'd expect from a rising one star place. There's definite potential and I really hope that the 'Guide Michelin' inspectors have been. The added touches of being directed/part escorted in direction of the bathroom etc. Wine list and cocktail list great, especially the 'Love Potion number 9' this time around, being lunch time, we had the set lunch menu and two of our party had Ã  la carte, seamless delivery of dishes, bread, top up of bread, free chilled and specially bottled tap water. Never a time where there isn't a member of staff available and none of the usual waving your hands around to call people over as happens so in Singapore! Nor the local trend of sitting with dirty/empty plates in front of you! Great value, great location, helpful, friendly, well-trained staff. I think this is a safe bet for perfect food and service, it's casual and smart at the same time, I love that balance between people on special occasions as well as people having set lunches or people who enjoy fine dining on the bistro style side. Can't wait to come back!
4
Celebrated my husband's birthday here. Service was friendly and attentive. Nice moist warm bread to start things off and the cured meat was an excellent appetizer. We had the traditional fish and chips and the Irish angus grass fed ribeye steak for mains. Fish was a little dry, just like the beef (which we ordered in medium), but overall was still tasty and enjoyable. Desserts were excellent; the monkey shoulder cheesecake (which came with a complimentary candle and birthday song from the staff) and chocolate fondant. I guess we started well and ended well. :) On a side note, though the prices are a tad more expensive (we spent around $180 for two), this is more than made up for by the complimentary bread, little touches like the ketchup in a jar from wilkin & sons, and attentive service. Will be going to London in Aug, perhaps will pay a visit to the branch there to see if there's a difference.
5
Because my husband and I are not overly romantic, a casual dining where we enjoy a good meal is one of our best celebrations. The steak was huge but it was pricey for $60, worth it though. The pork belly was the best, crunchy and baked to perfection. Will definitely come back here with the kids. We spent $290 for 2 persons.

Headed to BSK for dinner with some friends. I'll never understand the attraction of putting restaurants in shopping centres, but it seems to be the done thing here in Singapore. Attempted to reserve a few weeks out and received emails telling my my reservation was pending, had to chase up the reservation with staff, so not a great start. The restaurant itself is nice- low lighting but enough to read menus, and not too noisy so conversation with friends was not a problem. Cocktails at the bar before dinner were good, with a good selection of spirits beyond the standard stuff. Service was average- polite but not overly friendly and fairly efficient. I had high expectations of the food but was pretty disappointed. It wasn't bad.. It was just a bit on the ordinary side. Standard pub style food at celebrity chef prices. Highlight of the meal was dessert- the chocolate fondant with salted caramel and ice cream was delicious. In short, a nice meal, but overpriced for the quality of the food

Had lunch here midweek and was delighted with the food. All of us had fish in various forms with the absolute stand out being the (gorgeous) spicy tuna. This is a must have as a starter. Highly recommend the fish and chips also. Difficult to fault as a restaurant except the location, Marina Bay is not a favorite or mine. Notwithstanding that I highly recommend on both quality and price
4
The prices were reasonable considering location and brand. Service was good and they were accommodating of a stroller and such. Cant really complain about anything, which is a good sign I suppose

Usually steer away from new, trendy places - especially in Singapore as great overseas brands are often marred by dreadful service but this place is well worth a visit.Greeted on arrival and showed immediately to a nice table - the resturant is really light, airy and nicely furnished. Water offered straight away (free!) and our glasses were refilled quickly and often - no push to buy water (one of my pet hates!) and all the servers were connected and professional.Bread basket arrived - again no prompting and no hassle to order.The lunch menu is $40 for two courses and three choices for each course - I had the Pumpkin and Chestnut soup - just delicious! My friends had the ham terrine and salmon rillette - all very good. Main courses were between crab cakes, aubregine bake and my friend chose the watermelon, avocado, feta salad - all the meals were really good - nice portion size and fresh ingredients.We chose to share a single pudding just to taste it - again, the staff were charming, bringing three spoons and making sure we were happy - Bakewell tart and vanilla ice cream...whats not to like?All in all, excellent service - the staff were unobtrusive but our glasses were refilled quickly, no hard sell and lovely food.Can't wait to return

A really interesting new restaurant in Marina Bay shopping centre. Hard to choose from the menu but went for blue swimmer crab tagliolini and the warm bang bang chicken salad - all very good. Also had the mandarin, dark chocolate pavlova. Nice to eat outdoors - yes Singapore can be steamy but nice to be away from air conditioning

We went shopping at Tiffany Marina Bay Sands with our daughter. Knowing that we love our food, she suggested we should not miss Bread Street Kitchen ( Gordon Ramsay). We were exited to eat dinner there. The location is spectacular. The British European food was so tasty we cleaned the dish to the last crumb. Service no doubt one of the best. But how can it not be... with training under the Award Winning Celebrity
4
The location doesn't have a lot a of vibe - but the food is well presented and tastes good (very reilable and a 'safe' menu). I had a business dinner so it was a good place to talk and a relaxed environment
3
I recently had dinner at Bread street kitchen while in Singapore for business. The location is spectacular with views of the financial district and river. The restaurant is located in Singapores most swanky shopping mall. Food was good but nothing to write home about. I had the scallops and black cod. Service was top notch, nothing to fault.
4
The restaurant has 2 floor, so if you are wheelchair bound, please use the lift.The service is good and quite interesting if you are sitted right outside their open kitchen concept
3
So i met this girl on tinder and we decided to meet up. She frequents more of these branded restaurants than i do and suggested that we came here. The location and ambiance was excellent as it's has a great view into singapore and the skyline of the financial district. We ordered a soup, a bang bang chicken salad, Angus steak and a trout. I was surprise that the salad was the best out of the 4 items ordered. The Black Angus was extremely average with a very basic peppercorn sauce served with a quarter slice of grilled tomato. I'm not going to comment on the rest as it was really not worth mentioning. On a good note, service and the view is worth an afterwork drink and appetizers stop over
5
We had one diner there, the staff is great, the place is really nice and the food is good. We had diner outside and this was realy grea
2
The fish and chips i ordered was a lot worst than the one I had i one normal pub in London. Mr. Ramsay stop making new restaurants and make sure the one you have are serving good food, because your name stands behind it. Great staff by the way

Do not understand that you need to make reservations three months in advance, because we do not think it´s worthed.Nice location but very overpriced, overrated.We managed though to have brunch at the bar without having a reservation. Very disappointed with the food in general. The chicken wings were too heavily "breaded" and lacked taste: tamarind? The chicken was tasteless too. For a third of the price you can eat at the foodcourt of The Shoppes a way better seasoned chicken. Would not recommend.Gordon Ramsay need to check out his restaurant in Singapore soon
4
Great food with a good view They even have kids menu and amazing grills Must try the lamp chops and the chicken bbq .......
3
I have been here twice to try as many dishes as possible - constrained by my own appetite ! The menu is interesting and has enough choices. Portions are adequate and not too big . Food is generally tasty though some are better than others. The spiced chicken wings, flatbread butternut squash, fish and chips, shepherds pie are good! Others generally lacked the zing or excitement or robustness of flavour which I would have expected from a Ramsey restaurant.the black cod is average, the butternut squash lacks taste , curry chicken pie was diluted and quite poor. The desserts fare better- dark chocolate creme brûlée and banana sticky toffee pudding are excellent !Drinks are quite expensive and I felt even if they were satisfying, pricing was steep.Service is good , the staff are young , polite, attentive though during busy periods, you may need to wait a while to be served. An average experience and in some ways disappointing because I enjoy watching Ramsey and was hoping that his energy , enthusiasm and love for food would translate into bread street kitchen - sadly this wasn't the case on both occasions
5
Booked a wrong date, but the service staff called me 5 days in advance to confirm my appointment and managed to find another slot for me. Great job on this. We sit in the open kitchen area, food wise quite great I should say. The scallops appetizer were FANTASIC. Ordered a Angus beef, medium but turns out slightly on the medium well instead but nonetheless, the blue cheese sauce pairs well with the steak. Pricing wise, slightly on the high side but you paid for the ambience (well it is in MBS, can't expect low price)
5
We went there unsure of whether we could get in without a reservation. No problem! Food excellent and great prices. Wine expensive but that is Singapore
4
I've lived in Singapore for 6 months after moving from the UK and have craved a good traditional Sunday roast for a long time. The good news is that Gordon Ramsey's Bread Street does not disappoint. Could have done with a larger portion of gravy and at S$45 +++++++ (what is it with Singaporeans not advertising prices properly!?) it's not cheap but we had a lovely lunch in nice atmosphere and would definitely recommend.

Having walked what seemed like the entire are of Singapore, and having just watched the Light and Water show, we walked a little further along the waterfront and found this restaurant. The staff were entertaining and helpful, and we sat at the bar and ate fish and chips and drank Somerset cider. It wasn't at all how we intended to spend our evening in Singapore, but it was worth the money

We were fans of Gordan Ramsay's television shows (Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares etc) and were bent on dining at his restaurant in Singapore.Our tastebuds were buzzing when we bit on the bread. Following that, the seared scallop starter had a textbook luxuriousness.And then, as I thought about the main meal there - the blah baby chicken thing with the blah chimichurri sauce and the blah burnt lemon, the fish and chips with the, yawn, crushed peas - I would doze off only to awake a few days later, my face stuck to the desk.The baby chicken looked like a science experiment gone wrong. One slice of the knife reveals the grossly undercooked bird. It looks malignant and was so disturbing. How was the fish? Who knows? All I could taste was glop.Too many other things weren't good enough. And the mark-up! The cheapest main on the menu is fish and chips for $26. The issue is less the exact numbers, but whether you end up looking at a dish and questioning the value. Here you do.The compelling sense is that Ramsay, probably Englandâ€™s most famous chef, draped in Michelin stars, has no feel for this end of the market; and that his name, tarnished or not, is not enough to rescue this sterile venture from sublime irrelevance. This is the true truth as I say it as it is..
5
Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay, tasting the food in his restaurant is one thing I always wanted to do. I booked the table 1 month in advance as I heard that the restaurant is always packed. The complimentary bread basket was tasty and the service staff was attentive be even though the place was busy. We had the tuna starter and the scallops. The scallops was cooked to perfection and the tuna tartare was tasty and flavourful. For mains we had the cod and pork chop. The cod was lovely but the pork chop was a little too oily. Overall the experience was wonderful and food was great.

I wished I checked the reviews for this restaurant before hand. I usually would check the reviews on Tripadvisor or Hungrygowhere before visiting a new restaurant but since this is Gordon Ramsay, one would expect nothing less than excellence. Boy, was I disappointed. We ordered 3 starters, seared scallops, tamarind chicken wings and salmon ceviche. The serving for the seared scallops was very small, 3 tiny scallops on bland carrot puree. The chicken wings have good seasoning but very dry. The salmon ceviche was simple slices of salmon with grapefruit juice, nothing memorable.The entrees were equally disappointing. We ordered the grilled parrot fish and roasted duck breast. The parrot fish tasted ordinary, no wow factor. The duck breast was tough, the kale was not a good pairing because it gives the dish a bitter taste. Overall, on a scale of 1-10, I'd give the dishes a 3.Desserts. The fondant was ok, but the chocolate brownie didn't taste much. I wasn't kidding when I said "didn't taste much" because it tasted like cardboard. No sweetness, no chocolate flavor, the most tasteless desserts I've ever had.Service was relatively good but it doesn't compensate for the poor quality of food. This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to. And for the price of close to $100 per person, one would expect something decent.This is a restaurant I'd definitely not return or recommend to anyone. In fact I'd tell others not to go to it. Perhaps Gordon Ramsay should eat his own cooking before he yells at other chefs

nice ambience- modern and cosy bistro.Staffs were friendly and helpful. Lunch menu 2 course for $40, 3 course for $48 which I think it's on the pricey side as we can get equally good or better food elsewhere in Singapore with the same price or not lower.Wine by the glass is $20++ and above. Lunch menu was interesting and innovative comparing to other bistros in Marina Bay Sands, which is good.The food wasn't quite up to what we expected. We find the food a little bit too rich and sometimes it's hard to finish the whole thing as the palate was already overwhelmed.So, overall, wasn't impressed.Perhaps will give it a try again after the menu has changed. and get 2 course menu instead of 3 course instead.

2 of my friends and myself made reservations about 3 months prior to our actual dinning date of 2 Jan 2016. We were so looking forward to the place as we expected more from Chef Ramsey than Jamie Oliver's restaurant, especially on the food.First of all, we were quite disappointed that our reserved table was on the lower level of the restaurant where it's facing inside view of the MBS Mall and the open kitchen was nearby so the 'aroma' was not so pleasant - hair and clothings had food smell after walking out of the restaurant. We were actually expecting to be dinning upstairs where we can get the scenic view. Secondly, a slim, fair caucasian guy came to wait on our table and we asked him to recommended some dishes to us since it's our first visit there. Not only did he have a straight face (no smile from him - at least i never spotted any throughout the meal) but he tends to look at us in a not so friendly way (looking down on too-casually-dressed asians in a so-call celebrity fine dining restaurant maybe?) and spoke with an obvious snobbish tone. We nearly wanted to walk out of the place but end of the day, we wanted to give 'face' to Chef Ramsey as he seems such a nice & friendly celebrity so we tolerate since the other 2 ladies and an Indian guy (seems to be local) were so friendly and accommodating attending to us that made up for the negative attitude we 'suffered' earlier from SOMEONE. For example we intended to share food for that meal so when we asked him how big is the portion of the main course and he replied bluntly that 'I do not know how to tell/explain to you but in Europe we do not share food' ... duh...The food in general was somehow decent only but the cut meat we felt are too thick (eg. the duck breast). For the starter - pan fried scallops was to my liking though, perfectly done and the mashed potato was silky & smooth so that was good too.Will I recommend to my family and other friends? NOWill I visit again? NOi felt more 'at home' and cheerful when I visited Jamie's Italian twice though the food was not fantastic, i went back for the environment and atmosphere of that restaurant as I was willing to give them another chance to try more of the food.and furthermore their staffs were way more friendlier during my visits - ALL OF THEM!Anyway, thanks for the experience and I am sorry, Chef Ramsey

We weren't quite sure what to expect when my partner and I visited today, but we did at least think we would have fresh and tasty, locally sourced food. Not so, I'm afraid. Fish and chips with frozen fish - from New Zealand apparently - basically the type of rectangular block of battered fish you see advertised in a certain downmarket Brisih frozen food store. It was served with crushed peas, which to be fair, were actually rather nice. Some of the other diners looked to have slightly more appealing looking plates of food but overall I was not impressed. Will not be going back

I don't know where to start. Online confirmation received. follow-up phone call to confirm reservation 24 hours prior followed by another call 5 min before reservation. We show up 2 min before reservation time only to be told "no table". Raised issue to Head of operations at MBS for the way my family treated. One patron has subsequently confirmed that BST did give my table away to a walk in just prior to my arrival .. leaving us SOL Then I have my FB comments censored. Besides the embarrassment, I was treated as If i did something wrong :

Have been a fan of Gordon's TV shows. First time to ever eat at one of his places. Vibrant atmosphere, modern interior. Nice view on the bay. Helpful and friendly staff and of course good quality food. Had the English breakfast, very tasty and gods quality
1
The worst fish and chips I have ever had, extremely oily and no taste at all! Bad service. We were seated at a VERY hot corner by the kitchen and we kept hearing the cooks scream ," service" all the time once the food was ready for pick up! We will not go back!

I have been a fan of Gordon Ramsey for a long time and have eaten in one of his London restaurants so I was excited to find that BSK had opened in Singapore. My husband booked a table before we left the UK. On arrival the staff were very pleasant and the bar staff were exceptionally friendly. The food was lovely and there was a great atmosphere. The only disappointing features were that firstly we mistakenly thought the restaurant was in the hotel not the shopping mall and secondly we had to leave the restaurant and walk through the mall each time we needed the bathroom as there wasn't any facilities in the restaurant itself.
5
The restaurant has a good position and looks out across the bay we had a very relaxing meal. I chose the slow cooked belly pork with a side of mashed potato. The pork was cooked perfectly and was amazing.

Located in Marina Bay Sands shopping mall, Bread Street Kitchen is definitely a place to celebrate a special occasion with the nice atmosphere and delicious food. I had caesar salad (delicious bacon), short rib beef burger (medium rare), seared scallops and shepherd pie. It was delicious. The butter that came with the free bread was also very nice. Portion here is not too big (but not too small either), so you can try more variety of food or save some stomach place for dessert. Price wise, it is above average. Service was excellent, thanks to Scott whom was attending to us. He was very friendly and attentive.How to get there: MRT - Bayfront MRT stationCab: Tell the taxi driver to go to Marina Bay Sands shopping mallp/s MUST make reservation to avoid disappointment If you think this review is useful, please click on the "helpful" button.

We booked an early table for dinner on New Year's Eve at 7.45pm before heading onto the Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands for the fireworks. After the hassles of getting to the Sky Park we wished we'd booked the late dinner sitting and spent New Year in this wonderful restaurant.Even though it was very busy, the staff were excellent and ensured we were looked after as guests rather than customers. The New Year menu was excellent with the stand out being the Beef Wellington, which isn't a simple dish to master. The wine we ordered was fantastic and the waiters and waitresses ensured our glasses were never empty. The price was also reasonable at $280 for two before wine.The best Gordon Ramsey restaurant we've visited and a breath of fresh air after the disappointment of the one at the St Regis Hotel in Doha. Well done guys, and thank you for all your hard work while others relaxed at dinner

What a great spot for our NY Eve celebration. The staff were so good to us but the stand out was Jenna the assistant manager. She was amazing and so welcoming. We had some amazing food but the stand outs were the Fish and Chips, the Pork Sliders and the burger were to die for. The risotto was a little too salty. What a great venue and what great staff. Loved it.
4
It was excellent from the canapÃ©s all the way to the desserts. The only exception was the main course, insane portion (feeds about 3.5 adults) and was way above average in taste but nothing to write home about. Be prepared for a journey of flavours, I won't be forgetting this meal anytime soon.
5
We were lucky to get a reservation at the restaurant for 4pm of Dec 31. It was really full as they were busy preparing for new year dinner.We ordered the slow roasted delly porkchops (so tender and tasteful with a crunch tasty top)and shepherd pie (juicy lamb and creamy potato). Both were great. Our side order of onion rings was great too. We ordered 2 desserts recommended by the staff which were also very good. Service was efficient and friendly. The place was really nice. It surpassed our expectations. Great job Bread Street Kitchen

Every trip to singapore I would see the billboards promoting Gordon Ramseys restraunt and I thought "gee that sounds a bit too fancy for me". But when looking at romantic, intimate places my wife and I could go to for lunch I said "let's try it!" I was super excited to get a reservation and our adventure started!Firstly to get to the restraunt requires a very long walk through the marina bay sand shoppe which would normally irritate me...but this shopping centre is a tourist Mecca, it's array of speciality posh stores and even a waterway where you could be taken via rowboat through the shopping centre! Plus the long walk certainly stirs up the hunger juices!I was quite surprised when walking in to the restraunt at how small it was. For a "celebrity restraunt" at such a location you'd expect a large dining area, but no it was very small. Yet very intimate, with a beautiful city view which made us feel like we were the only people there (plus it was very empty).Firstly the only negatives I have (hence 4 not 5 stars) was some of staff service. I had read some pretty bad reviews on the staff on here and online and while they were extremely friendly and helpful they did do some interesting things. Firstly after ordering off the set menu, our entrees arrived promptly which was a delight yet there was a 20 minute break before the waitress came over and said "I'm so sorry the kitchen didn't get your docket so it'll be 5 minutes for the food". How can they serve the entrees without the docket hmm? The second course came about 20 minutes later (it was a pie so duh it wasn't going to take 5 mins to make). Also when we asked for the bill the same lady said "I'm sorry we put you down for the 2 course set meal instead of the 3 course set, so you get the desserts for free" which was cool but...how do you mix that up! Plus the place was super empty so it shouldn't have taken so long to bring the food out or misplace the docket.On the positive side, love the decor, one side your looking into the shopping centre at a big wall with huge photos of old singapore (I liked it) while the wife had the city view. The tables were a good space apart so when the table next to us was taken we were able to communicate without being disturbed by the people next to us. The food was great! Especially the turkey curry pie which was unbelievable! The staff were ver polite and overall I loved the whole time there

We stumbled upon Bread Street Kitchen on Christmas Day whilst looking for a light lunch venue in the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. The manager was able to offer us a great able overlooking the marina despite being very busy on Christmas Day.The service was very good, though we were only staying for an hour.Our choices of food were good and though a bit more expensive than other restaurants, the location more than compensated for the slightly higher costs. The only criticism would be that chocolate fondant might be better served with vanilla rather than mint-choc-chip icecream. Would certainly return again when visiting Singapore, though probably for a more substantial meal than the light lunch we enjoyed
5
We wen for lunch as a very big group ..16 persons. There were some confusion about the pre-ordered set lunch menu but the staff were able to straighten that out quickly. Food was good and creative and I love my fish and chip.Black Cod was also excellent. When 16 persons all enjoyed their food, it says a lot about this restaurant. I would love to return to this restaurant when I return to Singapore again
5
Went with some friends the first week it opened and must say, it was absolutely fantastic. I've been disappointed by celebrity chef restaurants before, but everything about this place was almost perfect. The service for drinks was incredibly slow, but I guess they'll have teething problems when they first open. Well hopefully try to visit again soon, although seems to always be fully booked!
4
Went for lunch with 3-course set at $48 per person. Food served were good and different. Service was excellent and many servers assisting all times.
4
This restaurant and bar provides is well designed, staffed courteous and knowledgeable.
The food is consistently good but I must say is not cheap.
3
We went for our Christmas dinner and made reservation in advance. The service staff was attentive and friendly, they know what's in their menu and this is important. Food wise, I highly recommended the fish and chips. Fish was at the right thickness and does not crumble when you cut through it. We also ordered their Irish steak rib-eye which was so so to be honest. We tried their dessert, the pie with creme fraiche ice cream which was again average
5
The food in this restaurant is to die for! Absolutely recommend the scallops and the lamb chops! My boyfriend and I make jokes that we are no longer able to enjoy food since nothing compares to the quality and perfection of this restaurant
4
I have been to this restaurant twice. On both occasions the service was good, the food was good and the bill was higher than expected. Obviously they are in prime property in Marina Bay Sands but the prices they charge there are better restaurants. The food and service are good but the price I would expect better. Reliably good, but not the best value for money. Ok, if you're on an expense account but if you're looking for value for money there are many other places
5
We went there for lunch; it was kinda hard to get a table but the food was excellent. Highly recommended
3
Visit the Bread Street kitchen today. I must admit we had big expectations as our experience of Ramsey restaurants we have been to is excellent. As always the service was excellent. And food timing was good. Our only disappointment was the food. Don't get me wrong it is good quality but nothing exceptional. There is nothing to suggest it is a Ramsey restaurant bar the service quality. We had the big breakfast and lobster roll. No drinks. Total bill $62.00.
4
Entered the restaurant and was greeted by NOT the friendliest of reception. I made reservations for a business lunch for a party of 8, so was a bit apprehensive with service standards with this initial "greeting". As it turned out, the food was very enjoyable and we had 2 terrific Filipino staff that took good care of all of us. This place is good for casual dining or business meals. Good location and nice view of the bay.
4
We dined here twice and the scallops were fantastic. We heard alot of negative feedback about Bread Street Kitchen when it was just opened. However, it did not disappoint us. All our orders came out right and delicious. We were given an indoor long table because the haze was bad even though we only had 3 persons. There were 3 other customers sitting at the other end of the table. In between was another empty table. The restaurant was not fully booked but the staff turned away some walk-in customers as they wanted to ensure that every table had its own privacy

My wife and I visited Ramsay's BSK at Marina Sands one Sunday lunchtime. The menu is quite reasonable and as many have written before, it's a mix of traditional British and local fare. This is a two storey restaurant and we were seated in the larger, busier, noisier section on L1. I would have preferred downstairs as it looks and feels a lot more intimate but for a Sunday brunch rather than an intimate dinner, it didn't really matter. The service throughout was very good. Attentive, present but not hanging around, they even managed that seemingly rare thing in local terms and provided the starters to start, the mains afterward with a nice break in between. A point many other restaurants have yet to learn. Now, food. We plumped for potted beef brisket with grain mustard, piccalilli and caraway crackers for me; seared scallops with carrot purée, bacon, apple and celery cress to start. Both were excellent with the scallops beautifully cooked. I could have done without the crackers as they seemed superfluous but a small grumble in a good start. Our mains were a Ramsay variation of Shepherd's Pie and an Artichoke Risotto. The pie had a lot to live up to, it has long been a family favourite, one cooked at home from a very early age, and when done well is a great hearty meal. It also had the distinction of costing over $40.00 so it had to be good. Hmmm, not quite to be frank. The pie arrived in a small cast iron dish. It was red hot which is fair enough but it was lacking depth. The lamb was superbly cooked, tender and juicy. I just don't understand why the potato was being rationed. A thin topping wasn't enough for a luxury pie. On the other hand, the risotto that destroyer of Masterchef contestants, was spot on. A good portion perfectly cooked, you can't ask for more. All this was washed down by an expensive water and a good but pricey bottle of Prosecco. So, we walk away from Ramsay's with the thought that it was ok, not fantastic but worth a visit if for no other reason than to say "I have dined there". No repeat visit for us I suspect as there is better in Singapore but no regret in going. The food around us looked good and we all know well before we go to a star chef's restaurant that we will pay handsomely
5
Alessio and Carlo are worth their weight in gold! Brilliantly clever cocktails delivered with professionalism and passion for their jobs!
3
Disappointed with the food. I ordered the crab pasta, which was bland. There was not a lot of food choices either.The ambience is okay. The service was good. But food was what we came for. Maybe I expected too much. I left disappointed, unsatisfied with what I ate, and with a huge dent in my pocket
3
We have lived around the corner from this restaurant since it opened and finally got around to trying it. Unfortunately the hype was not all it was cut out to be. I have dined at several of Ramsey's restaurants in other cities and I have never been disappointed. They are usually of the highest standard but Bread Street Kitchen failed to live up to the others. Having said that I should maybe have anticipated this as the price point for Singapore is quite low. I had the Rib eye and it was only $60. For Singapore that is very cheap, so to keep the prices low I'm sure the quality of the cut had to be compromised. The starters of Sea bass carpaccio and Pumpkin soup were also under seasoned. This restaurant is probably acceptable more for a business lunch than dinner. If you do go, stick to the classics like fish and chips which can be done well at the cheaper price. I would rather pay double the price and get the high quality I would expect from Gordon Ramsey than be disappointed, won't be going back to this restaurant but I will eat at some of his other establishments

Went to BSK Singapore for lunch last week. At least two out four of us are fans of Gordon Ramsay. Maybe our expectation was too high, but the BSK certainly did not impress us. We arrived pretty early, and ordered our food right away. The starters were served quickly. We really liked the Seared Scallops, but that's the only dish that everyone liked. The King Prawns were just so-so. For the mains, my BSK short rib burger was not bad, but my friend's roasted cod fish tasted like steamed fish, and the duck breast was pretty hard. We also shared a pork belly, the flavor was good, but the skin was too hard. For the dessert, the cheesecake has a strange texture, more like a pudding... Service was good at the beginning, but when the restaurant got busy, things slowed down, and one of our add-on order was forgotten. Some of my friends said they probably would not come back again
3
Ten people all found nothing good in any dish. Many left the burger or steaks. When you have a simple menu the execution has to be way better than this. A few bad dishes like the risotto(soup) , burger and none which excelled. Service was good and attentive. Prices as expected a bit high for the branded Chef. No need to go back
3
When you see only a small fraction of the restaurant drinking wine on a Friday night, you know the wine prices are outrageous. The pricing of the wine is out of sync with the food pricing massively. The lowest price bottle is more than 3x a main course. The food is good with decent portions too
5
We went for lunch on a Monday - tried our luck at 11am as we did not have reservations. I tried the set lunch - it was a good combination of starter, main -smoked haddock and salmon fish cake- and desert- blue bake well tart - choices were given. Lovely food. Excellent value! Hubby tried Irish aged rib eye steak. The staff were very attentive and asked us how we found the food. When hubby gave feedback regarding steak being overdone, the staff was very apologetic and replaced it with a medium steak. Excellent service
2
Pop over unexpectedly for dinner at 7pm and it was full house without any reservation. Crawled my way back at 9pm and was in luck when there was a table for four. Ambience was good with views overlooking the promenade at street level. Ordered the Pork Belly, Risotto, Burger and Black Cod, Mac n Cheese and a bottle of wine. Thumbs up for the cod and MNC which was pretty good. Not forgetting spicy tune tartar. Rest were passable. Somehow, service was disappointing as the Caucasian service staff was pretty cold and we felt "rushed" with the order. The complimentary tartlets were too sweet to our liking. Worth a try if you are a fan of GR
5
Bread Street Kitchen was very attentive during the reservation process, noting our specifications, and providing us seating that suited perfectly. From the confirmation call to the wait staff, attention to (personal) details really places the restaurant up there in terms of service. Despite BSK being a casual dining venue, and its location in Marina Bay Sands, I did not receive any snooty attitude at all, even from the caucasian staff. We also had a surprise sorbet with decoration to commemorate our special celebration there.Food wise, you can't knock a Gordon Ramsay brand. Take the unassuming 'traditional' Fish & Chips - the fish tasted like a cod, unlike any cheap fish used elsewhere for a deep-fried dish, it was meaty, with bite, and not flaky, definitely not lacking in texture and flavour, perhaps a tad too greasy. Batter was tasty. The only times I used the tartar sauce accompaniment was for the chips, and not the fish. My wife loved the wide-cut chips, but I didn't fancy it as much, as it got soft pretty quick (I do love double-fried shoestring fries). The smashed peas didn't do much for me, but it was easy to scoop up and eat I suppose. Downside is that the portion of fish was a bit small.The Dingley Dell Pork Belly was by far the best pork dish my wife has had all year. The meat was amazingly tender, flavourful and sweet without any 'porky' smell and the crackling was very crisp without any charred notes so common in roast pork. Perfectly salted as well, with a delicious apple dice and wholegrain mustard sauce on the side that really cut through the richness. Good portion size, and the complimentary bread basket and salted butter were excellent.And that Mac & Cheese classic. Heavenly. Again, the cheese is not your run of the mill cheese wiz. Rich, creamy and velvety cheese sauce blanketing the perfectly al dente macaroni. Well balanced so you get to indulge without feeling overly stuffed or guilty adding on a dessert to end off the meal. Hint of garlic adds taste interest to a simple dish. You will keep on eating it. Perhaps cos the macaroni was cut quite small. I think I over-ate on this.For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant. It was well baked with a good, slightly crisp crust that was easily breached with a tap of the spoon to reveal the deliciously molten, scaldingly hot interior. We gobbled it down despite it being steaming hot, the bittersweet chocolate offset by the mild mint ice cream was an irresistible combination.Exquisite experience - highly recommended

We sat outside overlooking the promenade, superb food, wines and service. Try the traditional fish and chips and lamb chops! Lucky to get a table as we hadn't made a booking. Lovely complimentary breads and with my hungry adult males they brought out more while waiting on our mains! Nice touch!

Popped over to Bread street during a break in he Grand Prix action. took a short while to get a seat as we hadn't booked and they were qute busy, so was impressed by how quickly we were seated.Had a coupe of cocktails and starters and mains. was surprised that this was cheaper than some of th trendy places in chinatown. Was expecting a gouging given the location, but was pleasantly surprised. Food was great too

Been to Bread Street Kitchen several times and I must say, food is excellent and service is amazing!Seafood is always fresh, meats are done to perfection.It’s not cheap but it’s not amazing expensive as well. There have been mixed reviews about this place but our numerous experiences have always been good. There were time when we just walked in and they were very accommodating and managed to get us seats despite being crowded. Music can be a little loud but its funky and adds to the feel and design of the place.We will be back to try the complete menu.Tip: Book well in advance via the internet. Alternatively, try your luck and give them a ring during off peak hours, sometimes there are slots available

My daughter is a big fan of Ramsay and his junior master chef series so decided to bring her to dine at this restaurant.Frankly we find the food overrated. We ordered the Sunday roast which is not too bad and the other 2 dishes nothing much to wow about. It's my 2nd visit though the first was also disappointing.
4
We went here for the first time this past weekend. Showed up 30 mins before our lunch reservation but still got seated right away. Stuck to the dishes that should be good here - fish & chips, short rib burger - and we were not disappointed. Busy place and friendly staff. Would try again..
3
Went there on Saturday around 16:00 to have dessert. Had to wait for a good 15mn to get a table set...with a few European managers who seemed a bit lost in their duties (I was visiting from the UK). Interesting as several tables were free...anyway, it was set in a lovely way...then we ordered, got some nice breads, and the desserts arrived. They were nice. All in all it was ok, a bit pretentious..

I cannot stress enough how good this restaurant of Mr Ramsay’s is. If you are planning a trip to Singapore you must book a reservation at this restaurant. We were lucky enough to have lunch here and ….. It beat all my expectations. I am a foodie; I am Italian and i love food. So having the chance to eat at a Gordon Ramsay’s Restaurant was pretty exciting. The bread they serve you while you wait for your meals was fresh and a great variety. The butter to go with the bread was AMAZING, I have never tasted butter like that before, it was full of flavour and silky smooth. I ordered the Beef Burger and my partner ordered the pork belly. Hands down one of the best meals we have ever had. The beef patty was so flavoursome, tender and cooked to complete perfection, the bun was soft and had all the right condiments inside as for the chips they were crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. You can tell the food is made with love and of the highest quality. For a simple Burger and Chips Bread Street Kitchen you have out done yourself

Maybe it was raised expectations, or the fame of the restuarant, was not particularly 'wowed' by my experience at this place. First we were ushered to high bar chairs for what is supposed to be a fine-dining meal, we of course asked to be re-seated at normal dinning tables. Staff in charge of sitting guests could be more attentive as we have to descend a flights of stairs to re-enter the restaurant again - albeit with one of us needing assistance. The duck dish was a bit too tough due to the thickness of the portion served, the steaks (sirloin n ribeye were a bit too raw even for medium), however the sea trout was nicely cooked. The portions were enough. The pineapple dessert was refreshing, the others were so so. Our waiter was however most attentive n helpful throughout our meal. He was properly the saving grace. Maybe we expected more, so this one time suffice for us, considering the price we paid for the experience.
5
Everything here is great! The staff are really friendly, the place is spotless, the food was awesome and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Prices are also really good and not inflated. We will be eating here again next time in Singapore. The only issue that I have is that the Coffee is average at best and too expensive but not bad enough to override all that good points at theis restaurant.

My family and I went to Bread Street Kitchen more out of curiosity than anticipation of a good meal. We are frequent eaters at Gordon Ramsey restaurants having eaten 10+ meals in at least 4 of his London restaurants including 4 meals at his Claridge's restaurant. We loved every meal. However, we then ate at his Maze restaurant in New York and were very disappointed. So we assumed anything outside of London was not good. We were wrong!!!!The service was first class. The lady that sat us made sure we were happy with our table. Then the wait staff was there at all the perfect times. And the food, OMG the food was amazing. I am not a fan of beetroot but the beetroot tart with goat cheese may be one of the best things I ever tasted. For main we had the hamburger, black cod, and lamb chops. All were done to perfection. Dessert was great and the wine they helped us choose was the perfect complement to our dinner.Thanks to everyone there for a delightful evening. We now know there can be Gordon Ramsey heaven, outside of London

Our dining experience felt a bit like an episode of kitchen nightmares.We ordered our three year old daughter the kids hamburger, she had one bite and didn't touch it again. Not wanting to be grumpy dad, i left her to have a healthy dinner of chips!When she had finished her plate, we three adults decided that the burger shouldn't be wasted, so we all had a taste - and in perfect unison quickly spat it back on the plate.The burger pattie was off, the meat rank and the taste disgusting. We informed the waitress, she removed the plate and offered us a replacement dish, but by then my daughter was full of chips, so we didn't take them up on the offer.We all laughed the many times Gordon has shut down kitchens and emptied restaurants on his kitchen nightmares show when the meat is off.When it came time to pay the bill, all of my daughters food costs had been removed, but lacking the quality control to serve off meat is not really good enough when you are paying over $100 per head.The rest of our meal was uninspiring, the scallops were good, the ceviche didnt taste like it had marinated very long and the bakewell tart was dry and unloved. It was a Friday night and the waiting staff were busy, but appeared haphazard, all in all it wasn't an experience i would want to repeat.We wont be back

Had a really nice dinner with friends at Bread Street Kitchen. It's certainly not cheap but the food was high quality. I had one of their signature dishes 'the Fish and Chips'. It was fresh, well cooked and tasty. Is it worth the price? Maybe not but it was still lovely. Shared a cheese plate for dessert which was great and well presented

I was being on a business trip in Singapore when I decided to check a famous named restaurant: Bread Street Kitchen! First of all I would like to congratulate the team as a whole, the food was delicious and good cocktail ( serve by Adonis, a kind bartender). I would do a little special mention for The hostess, Eliza . I was welcome in a very warm and professionally manner ( A beautiful smile ). I asked the hostess if I can go to my table even if I am early for my appointment: she accompanied me up to the one immediately. Seeing that I winced , because the table did not suit me , without even to ask her, Eliza proved a wonderful initiative . She proposed a table near the window with a wonderful view .This initiative suprised me in a very pleasant way and made my day: a perfect thursday . Nice moment in a Nice city

I came to this restaurant starving! Not until a day later I foung outnit belonged to chef Gordon Ramsey, no wonder food was superb. We had risotto, fish and chips and the king crab appetizer. I even told my husband this fish and chips are better that the ones we tried in the UK! Downside: service was scarce and slow. Everytime we needed something one of us had to stand up and ask for what we needed. Waiter came maybe three times to the table and only to deliver food, never to ask if we needed anything. Maybe it was the waiter or manager because of his demise. The great food made us forget the so so service. GREAT FOOD, I always wanted to try Chef Ramsey's restaurants! I am a foodie amd a big fan of his

I was visiting friends in Singapore and we decided to try Bread Street Kitchen, mainly because of its great location (and Gordon Ramsey Name), as it is right on the waterfront and has al fresco dining. I will say, the location is very nice and good atmosphere. I tried the signature Shepherds Pie and it was good. Service was prompt and cordial and food good. Was it great, no. But my Singaporean friends said they will return for Brunch. Worth trying. Not bad on value either..
5
Arrived here in hope Gordan wouldn't leave me left disappointed as his favorite saying is 'simple food'. Ordered the appetizer of a flat bread with capers, mushroom with a sweet potato spread was so simple but easy and tasty. For the main I had the beef burger and my partner ordered the risotto both were very nice and complimented with good service and drinks. Gordon's ideas of easy simple food show in his menu and chefs should take note of your going to charge a large thicket price than make sure you hit the mark and don't leave customers question why they visited. I left telling my partner Ramsey is my hero and revising 'SIMPLE FOOD
2
Maybe unfairly high expectations from watching too much TV but even when accounting for that we were dismayed with the package. When we arrived we were literally ignored at the door for maybe 5 minutes.. couldn't quite believe it.. and even as our expectations were slowly calibrated down we were constantly let down by average food and service. If there was not such a strong brand behind it i would have rated this 3* but given the level of expectation we have to give it a 2*.. Watching the TV will never be the same again
3
I was able to have an early lunch without making reservations.The food was good but I guess, I expected it to be amazing and it wasn't. The starters were really good. We had seared scallops and veal carpaccio for our hot and cold starters. We had the risotto and the sea trout as our mains. I loved the risotto but the sea trout was disappointing. The sea trout had a light broth with it. The broth tasted like something my mum could make.

~we showed up 1100am without a reservation to celebrate Francis birthday and were delighted when we were accommodated outside. Although it was noon and the sunlight was beating down on us we were relatively shaded but still hot as the haze wasn't as bad that day~service was slow, it came in courses with long pauses eg setup, water, order, drinks delivered was 30mins. First courses arrived at 45mins but the longest was main course by that time 12.30pm we'd moved into the air-conditioned restaurant and 2 of our group rushed thru their mains and had to leave. The rest of us had desserts and left at 1pm, for lunch anywhere Singapore 2 hours is long :(~on the plus side I remember the manager removed the charges for the wine bottle & cheese platter which we ordered so it wasn't on top of our F&B and we'd one main taken off because it was cold (a new one was served as well)~I had the Tagliolini again (OMG much much better than the last 2 times) THUMBS UP~cheese platter never fails to impress everyone, the collection BSK puts together is not to miss~apart from the wait & table moving, the food that our group had no complaints in fact even the re=served dish was good :)Francis (birthday boss) would have preferred western service standard at local speed and he could have had a better experience if offered a choice of redress vs the uncertainty of what and how management was to address the frequent feedback he gave during the mealKudos to the folks at the door for always accommodating people without reservations, I could see it literally fill up the room in 30mins before they could gauge the no shows :
3
So much has been said about Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. But how to keep the quality and the identity of Gordon Ramsay, when he is not here. The food is nothing to talk about. So many more Singapore talented chef can do much better. Service is fine, But you can see that lack of staff keeps lot of table empty. Hopefully the restaurant can mature nicely
5
Despite having no booking, we were given a lovely table and received friendly attentive service throughout our visit. My husband was blown away by his brisket entree and burger and fries mains - being somewhat of a burger connoisseur, he pronounced it the best burger he has tried so far! My pumpkin flat bread entree was also quite tasty and i enjoyed the mushroom risotto which was the perfect consistency and beautifully seasoned.Although we were quite full, we shared the cheesecake and raspberry sorbet, and were glad we did - it was delicious! The highlight for me however, were the amazing cocktails! The Love Potion no 9 was incredible, but then I had the Cosmopolitan! It was no ordinary Cosmo - the original 1930s recipe and it would have to do down as the best cocktail I have ever had - I was sad when I finished it!Would highly recommend Bread Street for a casual, comfortable, delicious meal, mind-blowing drinks and first-class service. We hope to go back again one day soon

love the fish and chips quality...i come here every time i visit singapore ...... pleasant and courteous staffs.. will definitely be back again soon!

Was there for my birthday lunch celebration with my wife. The ambient was good, service was alright and got a good table with fabulous view. We ordered the signature fish & chips, pork belly and mac & cheese. We love the mac & cheese, especially the crust covering the top of the dish. However we kind of let down by the mains, because we think they were just average, the fantastic purÃ©e kinda "save" them. I might be considering to come back for dinner next time to try the steak. Will see
2
It is now 20:14, we arrived at 19:50 and dinner is already over, check paid. I am utterly disappointed: the BSK in London is way way better. I've had a salad and it was so drenched in sauce that the leaves were all soggy. Despite the previous reviews, staff is quite friendly, but I honestly do not get how is it possible that a meal is brought to the table 4 minutes after ordered (my partner had fish and chips)! Perhaps that happens at mc Donald's...well at least there I wouldn't have to pay so much for fast food. What a shame!! I think Gordon Ramsay should come over and check upon his staff more often!

My partner and I had our dinner there on the 7th November to celebrate our anniversary. We had a reservation in advance but when we arrived, there was a queue and we started queuing as the host didn't great us and manage the queue well. The queue was also blocking the walk way outside and people seems lost. After some frustration, we decide to walk in and ask the host if we need to queue since we had a reservation and it was only then we were ushered to our seats. Would appreciate if the host acknowledges all the guests in the queue and manage the queue better. The servers were friendly but it seems like they were constantly rushing. It doesn't gives the diner a good feeling, Orders were taken in a hurry, food was served in a hurry. Slow it down and speak in a less hasty tone to the diners, i am sure all of us would be able to enjoy our meals better as well. The food was fantastic. The Cod and Sea bream was well prepared. We had the mac & cheese and also kale salad which was also equally good. Pricing weren't cheap, but it was value for money. The only food item, which was the scallops as our starters were terribly over priced for 3 small scallops which tasted way too average, do not waste your money on this. With the scallop, salad, 2 mains and a side, both of us were too full to go for their desserts. Bread serve were tasty and portions were generous. It is still worth a visit, i just hope the service was better and pricing on the menu probably needs a review
3
This was our 3rd visit and another planned for Dec 23rd for a large family gathering when our extended family and friends visit Singapore.On both occasions the food has been excellent , the atmosphere & location great but .......... incredibly poor service throughout both evenings , from the booking experience right through to paying the bill , we certainly expect much better value for money on the service front !!
4
Very pleasantly surprised. Good decor, very friendly and courteous staff, very good and fresh food ! Loved the grilled baby chicken, the desserts and the fish and chips. There were some very appealing appetizers we wish we could try , including spicy tuna tartar, sea bass carpaccio and the list goes on. Will definitely come back to try other things, defintitely will invite clients there as well for business lunch.

I had lunch at BSK 2x in a week - Nov 3 and Nov 6 ... hmmm that should tell you something about the quality of the food. BSK has an affordable lunch set ($48 for 3 courses) which works for the business crowd. The food is reasonably good. From the set lunch menu, the appetizers, flatbread with caramelized onions, pesto and tomato and the Hamachi tartare were great starters. As mains, the salmon fishcake was well done but the veal & mishroom pie a little too bitter for my taste, From the alacarte menu, the burger was a winner, nice and juicy beef patty with a tincup of thick cut fries. The ubiquitious Fish & Chips was a tad oily but we enjoyed the thick cut and flavourful batter. The pork belly was tenderly cooked with a crisp & tasty skin, another winner. The food and the great view of waterfront of Marina Bay should be good reasons to visit BSK.What about the service? Poor. On my 2nd visit, we were a group of 5, I was offended by the white waiter who passed inappropriate and condescending remarks. It started when he seated us. Service was slow but my dining companions were chatting so we did not make a fuss. The last straw came when we were charged on the bill for 2 coffees after the white waiter had told us that coffee came with the set lunch! He denied it when questioned. During my 1st visit to BSK, i was not charged for the coffee under the set lunch. Fortunately, the Assistant Manager Ms J Sendall saved the day and sorted the mess out for us. She was polite and understanding. Thank you Ms Sendall. The cost of the 2 coffees was small in relation to the total bill but we were upset with the poor attitude of the white waiter and with being given the wrong information. Would I go back to BSK? Would I pay for poor service? NO

Visiting here was on the top of our list. Unfortunately we were unable to book in for dinner through the hotel we were staying at as it was fully booked but upon arrival found that we possibly could have still ordered meals. We had a nice seating area out the front on the lower level and had a lovely view of the waterfront. Nice place to sit and people watch and just enjoy the city light's. Cocktail menu was huge with plenty of choices.
5
My daughter and I had a late lunch at the restaurant. Sat at the bar and was fascinated with the mixing of all the cocktails. A really lovely menu. A nice bread basket. My daughter had a starter blue crab pasta and we both had the nicest fish and chips. I had a fresh juice and she had a cocktail. We didn't have any puddings as we were full. Glad we got to eat there. Friendly staff. Really enjoye
4
Usual Ramsay food quality which is excellent. Great food and wine selection and although service was a little slow to start it was definitely not average or below. We really enjoyed the evening although the mall style location meant that the toilets were across the street thus the lower rating.
5
Amazing from start to finish, completely faultless! Scallops were stunning and the belly pork to die for!! Service was fantastic, can't wait to go back!
5
We were having a birthday celebration and decided to come here instead of the usual Haute Cuisine. I must say that Gordon has somewhat a reputation in Singapore, in addition to his work with Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon - we were looking forward to the meal.The ambience was very British pub, laid back, without the discreet quietness normally associated with French fine dining.The warm breads, salads, hot starters, mains: Fish and Chips and Shepherds Pie, carrot sides, and drinks were good. The manager Mr John Quetier made not one, but two special mouthwatering desserts for my wife's birthday, and did not charge for them.We will definitely retur

My wife and I are both fans of Gordon Ramsay and was eager to try this restaurant while in Singapore. On arrival with out a booking we were told that a table would be at least twenty minutes or a seat at the bar would be available immediately. After saying that we would wait for a table and a bar seat would not be suitable a table was suddenly found that could be ready in a couple of minutes. After being seated very hard to fault the service and the standard food although simple was excellent. Will visit again on my next trip to Singapore
2
Came in for a quick lunch and was attentively served by the friendly staff on duty. However the fish and chips was quite disappointing as it was over cooked, dry and had a flat taste. The pilsner was nice to drink on a hot day but overall the price were on the high side for a "British" restaurant. More of a place to hang out for drinks due to its noisy atmosphere
3
This is a Gordon Ramsay place but it is really just his name, we found the whole experience very average except the bill which was way above what it should have been for average food. On a plus point the decor is good but we found the food, staff and service very ordinary indeed and there was nothing special about any part of this experience. Overpriced on everything and poorly sized portions, wouldnt eat here again and there is so many more places to eat and impress in Singapor

Loved the view overlooking Marina bay n the Fullerton hotel. Staff was mostly friendly and service was brisk. We ordered fish and chips, ribeye wavy u steak and the lamb chops for main topped with a half lobster. For starters we had the sweet corn soup, Avocado and herb with cheese salad, Mexican wings and mash as well as some onion rings. The onion rings, salad and wings was good. Mash was pretty normal. The fish n chips was well fried, batter crisp and not too heavy, but much too salty for me. The lamb chop was done well, also too salty, otherwise quite good. The steak was a pretty good portion $68++!! But is was good albeit a bit too marbled. One complain I have is the corn soup - really too sweet for soup. Almost can match the sweetness of an Asian dessert soup! Loved the way the children were given a packet of crayons and another with a booklet for colouring. It was tastefully done! Kudos to Gordon Ramsay for this! Will come again if just for a few sides or dinner with friends and family, but will definitely ask for less salt in my dishes
3
First visited BSK @ MBS when it first opened in June 2015. Food was decent then; steak was good. Revisited in Sep 2015 to see if the restaurant had ironed out its kinks. Unfortunately, no. Service still wasn't up to standard; tried to be friendly but came across as fake. Place was extremely noisy (full house + loud music) during dinner as well.Food, with the exception of the Dingley Dell Pork Chop and Irish Angus Rib-eye Steak 12oz 28 Days Aged Grass Fed, everything else (fish & chips, pasta) came across as average at best. Expected more from GR, especially with the higher than average prices. Won't be back unless things improve or Beef Wellington gets introduced into the menu
5
This cool new restaurant has a contemporary trendy interior yet it is very relaxed and warm environment. The place was still rather busy at 5-6pm. I had late lunch at the bar over a beer...black cod with a side of chips. Loved it. Really tasty food, friendly service although a bit on the pricy side
4
The sweet corn lobster soup was delicious, it was a divine combination. We had the black cod and shepherd's pie which were very good and beware of the sriracha spicy sauce on the beef burger and be sure to ask for less sauce if your taste buds cannot take it
2
My husband and I decided to visit this restaurant on the last night of our holiday and we were extremely dissappointed. Firstly we were taken downstairs to a table in the corner, whilst upstairs appeared relatively empty. My husband ordered a Ceasar salad with no anchovies and it came with anchovies and a hair!! We then waited 40 minutes for our main to follow. When that arrived we waited another 10 minutes for condiments by which stage our main meals were getting cold. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and it has me off visiting other restaurants owned by Gordon Ramsey
4
Great atmosphere and excellent food.
Drinks were a bit slow on our visit, but this is a really nice venue.
4
We were there on a Friday night (with a reservation) and it was packed, nicely buzzy, side table with a good view. Food excellent, service also. Wine list a bit pricey, even for Singapore.
Would definitely go again.
5
The staff are very well trained and took careful care of our group with fast smart service and style. The bar has some seating that is partly outside if it's not too hot.
5
We went to Bread Street Kitchen after hearing the much Vibe around us about the place, must say the place was full on a Tuesday evening and there was no empty seats which we could have filled in.Being enough said the welcome at the gate was warm enough to let us know it will be 10 minutes wait for us to have table for 2, rest is all full of surprise from hereThe way servers introduce themselves , the way they describe the specials of the day , or be it there home made bread basketThe pork chop and fish and chips was our order , although we expected the pork chop to be a bit more juicy so we found it a bit dry and let one of the duty manager on the floor know about this, he was quick to rectify the issue and within 10 minutes we had the nice chop with peppercorn sauce side , we were also offered the complimentary dessert as a gesture , now this is something which really made the evening for us and we saw the effort they make to ensure the people leaving there door with full of smileKudos to Our server Kathie and Floor manager Manu for such a wonderful experience on our holidaysI can surely say this restaurant reflects the perfection of Gordon.
5
We were greeted by a great big smile from Alik and that was the start of an excellent dinner. We had the seared scallops and wood fire oven roasted king prawns for starters and they were perfectly done. We then had the highly acclaimed Slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly, spiced apple purée and Ramsay's famous Traditional fish & chips, crushed peas, tartar sauce. They use the Australian Red Snapper for their fish and chips and we loved both main courses. We cannot wait to go back to try all the other food on their menu. We finished the night with Chocolate fondant with salted caramel and mint chocolate chip ice cream and again, done to perfection and perfectly paired
3
I been in bread street kitchen 2 weeks ago... The place is amazing with a beautiful wiew ,the staff very friendly and with good skills,,the food is very nice but in a gordon ramsay restaurant i expected more about the food!! The wine selection is very good! But finally was a good dinner experience...

When news first broke that Gordon Ramsay was opening a restaurant in Singapore, I was fairly excited. The last time I had a meal at one of his restaurants was in July 2012, during my first trip to the UK, where I visited The Narrow. For a Tuesday night, the restaurant was quite busy. At about 8pm, some walk-in customers were told that the waiting time was an hour. Fortunately we had made a reservation. Overall, I thought that service was quite decent, but generally on the slow side. The assortment of breads to start were pretty ordinary. In order to sample more dishes, we decided to share all our orders among the 5 of us. We decided on 2 starters (based on the waiter's recommendations), 4 mains and 1 side dish. The starters we had were the tuna tartare and tamarind spiced chicken wings, which were quite nice. For mains, I enjoyed the Dingley Dell pork belly and the Shepherd's Pie, while I thought that the fish and chips and duck breast were disappointing. We had the chocolate fondant and cheesecake for dessert and I was very impressed. Without having high expectations, I was fairly satisfied with the entire experience. The meal cost $52 per person. The best dish of the night for me would have to be the pork belly, though the desserts were really enjoyable as well. I think service could have been slightly faster. We ended up spending well over 2 hours there
5
I ordered the Beef Wellington, a special of the day. Huge portion, accompanied by lots of vegetables - I certainly didn't leave hungry!Staff were attentive. I went mid-afternoon for a very late lunch and despite this, it still felt like it had a good atmosphere.If you are ordering a special of the day do look at the bill carefully as these are programmed into their computer. The staff were incredibly apologetic and very quickly corrected the issue which is exactly what I would expect of a venue like this.For me the test is not whether mistakes happen - it is how staff handle them when they do

"Go For It" I celebrated my birthday at BSK last month. It was a surprise treat by my friends. We had a reservation at the bar. The bar manager (William) was very charming. He genuinely asked us our preference for drinks before suggesting a few of his own, and i might say that i was not disappointed at all. The staff at the bar is very friendly and social. They sure know how to make you feel welcomed and special. The ambiance at this restaurant is sophisticated with a homey feeling to it. The lights are quite dim, but that gives privacy and nice soft rustic look. This place is nice for a person to come with their friends to unwind after a hard day at work or with family to just have an eventful night out. I have heard kids are given special treatment at BSK. They are given the privilege to work with the chefs or the bartender to concoct up their own drinks/juice and to cook their own food! Which seems pretty amazing to me.Food is scrumptious. They have a wide variety of dishes to chose from. The restaurant manager (Manu) himself came up to us a few times just to make sure our evening was pleasant. The staff there is very hardworking, efficient and they always seem to have a smile and the spark on their face.It is a casual dining restaurant but their qualities are no less than any five star rated dining places. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who would like to have a special evening out. The drinks are delish and laudable. I would specifically go to BSK again just for the drinks.

I had gone to BreadStreet Kitchen last week. I was there without a reservation but the team at the door was more than accommodating. They welcomed us with warmth and provided  us seats at the bar.The ambience is like an industrial setup with a rustic look. The drinks at the bar are exquisite. The bartenders and the bar manager whipped up interesting drinks for my husband and I. While my daughter was served a freshly made juice of her choice. We were then moved to the dining area. The service that followed after we were seated was par excellence. The assurance taken by the floor managers, be it the bar manager or the restaurant manager, is commendable. They are very prompt and friendly. The food is delectable. We ordered a variety of dishes. Ranging from Pork Belly, Fish and Chips, Mac n Cheese as a side dish to Risotto with mushrooms and shepherd's pie with braised lamb.  My daughter was given complimentary ice cream with cookies, and she loved every bite of it. It is quite an experience to dine at BSK. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wishes to tune out from the everyday hustle and bustle.
5
Celebrated my birthday here and was treated like a princess! The manager was lovely and all my colleagues loved the food. I would definitely come back here.
5
Excellent food in a great environment. Was surprised at the quality and variety of the selection and the decor and environment is great for all occasions.
5
Great food, with a nice mixture of local and European tastes. Make sure you have a table that overlooks the water
5
We booked a table for 20:00 hrs, but a due to traffic arrived late and lost our table. We had to wait about 20 mins and where shown to a table. The service is brilliant very professional and friendly. The food is even better, we had 2 fish and chips, 1 shepherds pie and a burger. Everyone loved their food and my daughter in law said it is the best fish and chips she has tasted. We all shared the monkey shoulder cheesecake it was delightful so tasty but light. I would highly recommend this establishment and will be going back

After going to Bread Street Kitchen in London, and loving it, I decided it would be a great thing to take my parents to the Singapore restaurant when they came up to visit. The restaurant has a great view and the interior is smart and funky. The maître d' was incredibly helpful at finding us an indoor table and the bar staff were also professional.The big disappointment was the food. My burger was so dry... I asked for medium/well and I think I got a chef with a "if you want it well done, you'll get it well done" mentality which isn't fair for the price you're paying. People are allowed to not like blood! My mother's Shepherd's Pie was also dry and her salad came as green vegetables and the waitress wasn't interested in changing it. On the plus side my father enjoyed the Cod.Not sure I could recommend this to other visitors to Singapore. There is a lot of good food in Singapore that has a considerably smaller price tag

Before our trip to Singapore we decided to book a table a Bread Street Kitchen and were excited to dine at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. On arriving, we needed to change our reservation to add two more people, so visited the restaurant itself to change the booking while on a detour to the Gardens by the Bay. The lady that we spoke to at the entrance was rude, didn't smile and looked us up and down in our casual clothes. She appeared to begrudgingly change our booking, to four people and we became apprehensive that our dining experience may not be all we had hoped. Thankfully, on arriving at the restaurant for dinner, the wait staff we dealt with were pleasant and helpful, food was delicious and service well timed. The chocolate fondant was a big hit with everyone on our table. I would recommend this restaurant to others despite the poor initial first impression

We needed to have an efficient lunch and I must say both the quality and speed and care was great. This is generally unlike singapore where service does at time lag. So well done. The set menu was simple and easy to select and the passion carpacio desert is to die fo

It was supposed to be my birthday treat from my friend. We were so excited and curious of the this famous Bread Street Kitchen and required 2-3 weeks advanced reservations to get a table. I would say service is not bad; about the same as U.S. service standard. Welcome Drink "Detox" was refreshing and nice. We were satisfied at this point till the Mains food came.We had a slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly with spiced apple purée and Fish & Chips as our Mains. I ate Pork Belly with spiced apple puree in overseas before, but I was shocked to see mine when it was presented to me. My food was not so warm-served too. Meat was tender, but was tasteless to me in overall. Fish & Chip was just one square fried piece, not much of taste. It is like if you closed your eyes, you won't know what are you eating actually. I have a Latte with no Latte design on top. Alright, I think Starbucks or Coffeebean will done a better job. The only thing that I really love is.... Tomato Ketchup which is in a glass bottle that looks like jam. That Ketchup saves me from my tasteless food. It tastes like jam at the same time like ketchup. With the price paid for such average or below average food, I would say go somewhere else in MBS (if not, foodcourt at basement)

I booked in for Brunch at BSK for 5 adults, a child and a baby, although it being busy for a Sunday we were attended to efficiently and attentively. Upon arriving I was suddenly torn between having the new brunch menu or trying the Sunday Roast as I saw all the tables eating some amazing looking food, but after sitting down and being given a complimentary taster of one of the new fresh juices (The Red Vitamin, which was very refreshing) I decided I would try the Brunch but mix in some starters from the main menu for my visiting guests to try too. The chicken wings are a big winner and a must try, accompanied with the tuna tartare and fresh bread, I knew I made the right decision. I recommended the BSK burger (another must do) which was duly ordered, and we also had an eggs benedict, a bacon egg mushroom roll and two orders of the lobster roll. I ate one of the latter dishes and was just satisfyingly full enough to leave some room for dessert. All my guest enjoyed their respective meals too and we capped off brunch with an amazing chocolate fondant (my third must try dish) with mint chocolate chip ice cream, a lovely banana sticky toffee pudding and a pineapple carpaccio with coconut sorbet. Again, I feel I made the right decision with this selection.At this point after having had a great meal with all the managers either serving us or checking in on us aside from out dedicated server, we had an added bonus surprise for our 2 year old toddler. Jenna, one of the assistant managers had come up to our table and offered a special kitchen tour for the little guy dressed up in a mini chef's coat and for him to make his very own Sundae treat!!! To me, this was just absolutely above board service, but for the little guy, he was all smiles dressing up and being allowed to make his own dessert right there in the kitchen! I would to extend a big thank you to Jenna and BSK Singapore for a very satisfying and memorable Sunday Brunch. I now look forward to dropping by again soon to try your Sunday Roast...

Beautiful setting and a beautiful view of the bay from the right window seats. Food is great and the kitchen does a fantastic job in preparing the food as requested!Speaking of made to order, do catch Adonis one of the star bartenders; he will make you a drink made to order, just tell him what you like and he will make it just for you!

Lovely setting, beautifull food, helpful staff. Travelled on the Grand Prix weekend, very busy, but defo worth a visit.

I had experience Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong and this one is far better in atmosphere and food was good with friendly and casual service. Luckily, I gave a try again.
4
In general: It was exceptionally difficult to get a date and time (especially on short notice) but we managed. Was entirely impressed by the menu that offered a mixture of comfort food and some not-so-common items. Taste: We ordered the Avocado on bread, Eggs Benedict and Caesar Salad. Some of the best Eggs Benedict tasted, everything was just nice. Their bread basket which comes with every table is a great mix and good filler. Ambience: great decor, can get quite noisy when the restaurant fills up but a picture-worthy place. Amazing view on a clear day. Service: it was better when there were less people but good service all-around. Great to see restaurant managers doing their rounds, getting their hands dirty and doing the work as well. Makes a great impression for management and the way its run. Tip: make your schedule work for the booking times available. Get earliest time possible - 11AM. Less noisy and crowded.Would definitely return to try the dinner menu

This restaurant has a fantastic service. I messed my my booking date but the host was able to find me a sit and I was so graceful. This restaurant provides unlimited breads n butter. I love the Alaska crab salad, wood fire king prawn salad n the main roasted pork n fish n chip. Prices were reasonable with great service
4
I was longing for a nice juicy burger and was glad they have it on the menu.i was so tempted to try other items on the menu but stuck to my craving. I was hungry so when the bread basket came I almost finished all but one bread roll... That didn't leave me much room for the burger. When it arrived, I didn't quite finish my burger but the mid-well patty I ordered was perfectly done. And that spicy mustard sauce was quite unusual. Had a couple of the mocktails and quite like the lemon tea mixture (can't remember the fancy name-sorry...)I'll definitely return for the other items in the not that extensive men

We took our time in trying out Bread Street Kitchen because previously, it wasn't so easy booking a table - especially for dinner. So finally, last week, we managed to get ourselves a dinner reservation just before we caught Saturday Night Fever musicale at 8pm. Bread Street Kitchen has a nice look and feel to it. The industrial design of the restaurant is actually quite charming. The lighting is cozy and warm enough to get customers in the mood to chat while savouring their food. The restaurant staff were lovely and polite and the Filipino staff who looked after our table was very helpful with his recommendations. We were a group of five and we decided to order a few things that we can all share and try together. Among those that we really liked were the spicy tuna tartare, taglioni starter, slow-roasted pork belly and the roasted duck breast. We didn't get to try any of the dessert or their wine selection because we were in a hurry to catch the show. We'll save that for the next visit. Having said that, I find Bread Street Kitchen to be a great chill out place with friends or partners but I don't think i would be rushing back to it anytime soon, given that Singapore has tons of awesome other restaurants to try. It was also my first time to dine at any of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. The food certainly is nothing exceptional (you just know that you've had better food elsewhere), however, all things considered, it truly was a lovely dining experience for all of us that night

Reviews hv been rather mixed on Tripadvisor and I concur. Mains are average - went with the fish & chips which was ok. Honeyed carrots are way too sweet. Chicken wings average. Desserts are quite good. Service is attentive. They notice it was my girlfriend's birthday and inscribed the birthday greetings on the cake plate. Ambiance is good for gathering of friends; we were seated at the basement 1 dining area, the main area is at level 1). It is at the end of MBS, which is closest to MBFC tower 3.

Doubting my first meal here I came back for the second time to confirm the lack of flavor or delectable dining that I have known Gordon Ramsay's restaurants to have - across experiences in London and recently from Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong (which I actually found very good)The not so bad - The hot starter seared scallops are decent though nothing spectacular especially for the price (S$24)- The Slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly with spiced apple purÃ©e was probably our favorite, large portion with crunchy skin coupled with tender and succulent meat (S$28). The horribilis- The Spicy tuna tartar, chili, garlic, sesame oil, wonton crisps (S$19) is probably the most bland I have ever tasted. In a blind taste test you would only literally taste chili flakes in a mixture of gelatinous tuna. Even the wonton crisps tasted like they came from a cheap of the shelf packet in the supermarket- Chips (S$10) unsalted and completely dull of flavor. No texture - not crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. McDonalds and burger king fries are 10x better (value and taste)- BSK short rib beef burger 7oz, Monterey Jack cheese, spicy sriracha mayo [and chips?] (S$28) - This was the complete letdown, even though my expectations were rock bottom post the tuna tartar. For starters, they seemed to have changed the menu to exclude the chips (even though it still is in in the online version of the menu) so they could charge you another S$10 for their sapless cut potatoes. As for the burger, this is the worst I have ever had, no flavor to the patty, undistinctive cheese and a dry white bun with the undifferentiated lettuce and tomato. We needed extra tomato ketchup to finish this up. I actually would prefer a MOS burger.Avoid like the plague. Go to Black Swan or even MOS burger to save yourself the pain

Arrived without a booking for lunch and paid the price by being crammed on to bar stools for lunch, looking in envy at the empty tables - good wine list and acceptable "pub food
4
It's has quickly won me over to come back for more....chance upon this place and was looking for a quick drink with a friend. We were pleasantly surprise by the ice cold beer served in a chilled pewter mug - best way to serve a beer in a tropical climate like Singapore! Fantastic embience and looking forward to come back for the food. One downside: service is lacking for the price the restaurant is charging.
5
One of the finest restaurant by Chef Gordon Ramsay at Marina Bay Mall... Great selection of dishes, excellent service & just glad to hv had this opportunity to dine with family..
4
We had to book six weeks in advance, but had a lovely pre theatre meal at Bread St.
I can heartily recommend the Dingly Dell Pork Belly.
Not the cheapest, but great quality.
Ivan heartily

Some "celebrity" restaurants bank on their name rather than their actual delivery. Not this one!!The Bread Street Kitchen has only been open a couple of months, but confidently runs perfectly smoothly from the moment you arrive. There is a good atmosphere and the servers are friendly with just the right amount of personality - attentive but not over bearing. Reservations are essential as it's extremely popular and rightly so. The menu is recognisable food done extremely well ... no unnecessary or frivolous foams here (thankfully)! I started with Scallops, liking the the smokiness of the bacon. Nicely balanced flavours. Perfectly cooked. While the baked black cod for mains was tempting, I opted for the lamb cutlets. Again, perfectly cooked (rare) and delicious. I'll be back here again for sure to try more of the tempting menu items on offer.

We really enjoyed our dinner here. They had an excellent kids' menu - our kids got the fish and chips and the mini-burgers and enjoyed them. I got duck breast, which was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty. My husband got the burger made of rib meat, which he also enjoyed. They also made absolutely perfect cocktails - a nice surprise because we live in China and often the cocktails are the weak link at even the best restaurants. Service was friendly and helpful. Good suggestions on what to order. Would definitely come back if we lived here
5
My family and I had no set plans for lunch so, when we came across "Bread Street Kitchen" and had a quick look at the menu, we easily found something each of us would enjoy. The friendly and attentive staff reviewed existing reservations and were happy to squeeze us in. My Risotto was delicious, my son devoured his traditional fish and chips and my husband's Dingley Dell pork chop was cooked to perfection. His side of spiced, homey carrots were amazing. Usually he wouldn't be too precious about sharing his vegetables, but, after tasting some, I can see why I wasn't offered anymore! A thoroughly enjoyable experience and a great location
4
So happen i was around Marina Bay Financial Tower 3 to work out and after i decided to walk over to bread street kitchen which was 1 month old. I went and ate Fish&Chips which is my favourite and reminded me since childhood!!! It was great, services were on-ball!!! Will come here again with friends

When you come to a restaurant under Gordon Ramsay, you come with certain expectations. Well, I would say the food and service are decent but nothing spectacular or memorable. In a very competitive restaurant scene in singapore, I wouldn't plan to return. If you like to try it for namesake, it's still a good meal.Maybe I tried it on a super hazy day that blurred the beautiful singapore skyline. Maybe that will help in the overall dining experience, so ask for a bay level sitting
3
We had a very high expectation of the food in this restaurant, but we found the food was at the average level, not as "glamour" as the Chef's reputation. Need to improve the quality of he food.
4
Went there for lunch, and have to say that it is worth trying although the price is a bit high. Had the pork belly and black cod for main and tuna and mash potato for side. Will return to try other dishes. The staffs were very attentive and friendly especially the bar staff as we were sitting at the counter. The only problem, always crowded... Hahaha
3
I guess I expected too much. I looked forward to experiencing the famous chef Ramsey's food. I had the fish n chips, my sister had the pork loin. We both had the iced summer teas. The food was ok. The service was also ok. The best thing was the dessert! Supposedly the favorite of Harry Potter - treacle treat. Simple but delightful. Maybe I have simple taste. I enjoyed the food but I wasn't blown away. For those who are thinking of booking a table here ( crowded so better to book ahead), manage your expectation so you can have a more enjoyable time. Interesting mix of patrons. I enjoyed watching the people who came to dine here. Families with babies in the pram. Obviously business lunch groups. Romantic couples. Bored mature men. Chatty young girls with shopping bags from designer stores. Tourists with cameras and maps open. Staff are well trained. They would give you the best smile. More water? Smile! Drink menu? Smile! Spilled drink? Smile!Ask for the seat facing the bay windows and watch joggers go by even with unhealthy air quality index warning.Enjoy your meal

We hadn't booked a table for lunch but gladly accepted two seats at the window bench which provided a lovely lookout. Not a cheap lunch but the food was superb and service attentive.

~This time I dropped in a hazy Monday evening with a colleague when we decided not to continue our weekly walk round Marina Bay.~In sports attire, we enquired about a table and was given the outdoor high table which was fine as we had no reservation and the place was starting to fill up :)~OMG while looking at the menu, I overheard the couple next to us ask the wait staff to take back the Tagliolini (yes the same dish I'd reviewed twice before) saying that there was an unpalatable taste in the dressing :(~We'd only ordered the two, Fish & Chips which was the same fine dish except for the mashed peas which did in fact taste a little like Colgate toothpaste! The Burger which I'd ask for well done came a bit medium and strangely with chunks that were not as edible in the beef patty. The tangy sauce on the crown of the bun wasn't as tasty as I'd read on TripAdvisor reviews.This visit wasn't as good as my previous few :
3
Some elements of bread street kitchen was good but others were mediocre at best. The bread basket was good and the accompanying condiments to the mains were exquisite. The fish and chips is pretty good and the only complain I have would be a better choice of meatier fish that can hold up to the crispy batter. The macaroni and cheese on the hand was too rich that 3 of us could only managed half the small pan
5
We approached this restaurant with caution. Mixed reviews & an unknown concept (to us at least) put us on our guard. Well, we needn’t have worried. Upon arrival, Elisa warmly greeted us & also checked-in with us during our meal to see that all was well - it was! Our waiter (sorry, missed his name) was also top-notch, friendly & showed great knowledge of the menu. Excellent stuff so far. But the food? The Lobster Tagliolini appetiser was absolutely delicious & the perfectly cooked pork belly totally sealed the deal. It was beautifully presented as was the fish & chips that my wife ordered. Everything was just how it should be. Unpretentious but upscale. We had a wonderful meal complemented by great staff & great food. It doesn’t get much better
5
Dropped in for a couple of drinks in the evening and some food. We were seated at the bar which was brilliant as we had a view out across the marina. The cocktails were great as was the food. We enjoyed s couple of starters and sides, can recommend the macaroni cheese! Thank you to William the car manager who was brilliant, very knowledgeable and makes a great gin cocktail. Very relaxed vibe and great place to spend a couple of hours.
5
I along with a group of friends visited this restaurant on the final night of our stay in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant overlooks Marina Bay of which looks even better at night and then there's the food which was up there with the best I've had anywhere!
1
As a chef of 30yrs in the trade I was so disappointed. Let me begin. We arrived for drinks at the bar ( the cider was awesome ) waited to be seated but then had to ask then was lead to a dark corner next to what look like a service area next to the aircon . When we asked to be moved to a table with a better position the waitress changed the subject and offered to turn the aircon down 10 minutes later she could see how unhappy we were and then moved us after a chat with her supervisor. Ceviche was so over powered with chilli you couldn't taste anything else. The Duck main course was chewy and not a trace of crispy skin, the sauce tasted like soapy vinegar. Rib eye main course.THICK MIUNTE more like it and bernaise sauce had no flavour at all with 4 tiny pieces of herbs. WOW!!!! Sweets..treacle tart was rubbery and tasteless and the bottom was burnt. For $450 your team needs to lift its game. On a positive note the Spanish $100 bottle of wine was the highlight of the night even though we asked twice for it to be decanted. Let's hope Mr Gordon Ramsey reads this
3
I went there with my boyfriend yesterday. We ordered a Tuna Tartar for the cold starter, which tastes incredibly good! After finishing the starter we had to wait for quite a long time to get our main course served. My boyfriend ordered the beef wellington and I ordered the Irish Angus Rib Eye. We both had a high expectation of the food, as this is one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, and my boyfriend is a big fan of him. Sadly, our main course didn't taste as good as our expectation. My rib eye tastes average, a bit salty. My boyfriend's beef wellington was overcooked, (he ordered the steak to be medium rare, but he got the medium well instead) and tastes not so good. However, we were glad with the service and the friendly staffs. Would be back and try another food on the menu, hope it won't disappoint us
2
I had the pleasure of going to this restaurant on Sunday 2;15 pm we made reservations to ensure that we do not wait. Once arrived we were seated promptly. After being seated we ordered our drinks which were served promptly. We ordered our food (sunday roast) and waited for our wine to arrive. Our food arrived and the presentation was excellent however the plate was luke warm so my meat was cold by my second bite along with the broccolini. What happened next surprised me. I noticed that there were fruit flies buzzing around the table and one ended up in my food i shooed it away. Through the course of the meal i killed three flies and more showed up. I called the server to tell her that there is a fruit fly problem she was not surprised and said yes we know of this problem and walked away. The quality of the food was very good though it was served cold. I hope that the management takes notice and fixes the fruit fly problem. serve the food on hot plates over. overall a mediocre experience
4
As soon as I hear celebrity chef I worry. This "Gordon Ramsey" restaurant however did deliver a very good meal. After getting off to a very slow start taking more than 10 minutes to find us a table and be seated we were greeted by friendly staff who immediately provided my young child with colour pencils book and chefs hat to be creative with. We ordered the lamb cutlets which were very tender and the duck which was cooked to perfection although the cranberry sauce was very sweet and the potatoes needed seasoning. As a side I would highly recommend the macaroni. The ambience was ok quiet busy and tables very close together. Otherwise a lovely meal to end a shopping trip as the restaurant is inside a large mall
5
We had to make reservations, weeks in advance. But it was well worth it!Food does not disappoint at all! And the service was top notch. The Wait staff was very accommodating, and all smiley and nice.My daughter was with us for lunch, and she had the kid's pasta which was really good. Great for kids, or adults with smaller appetites. We had the seared scallops to start, and they were delicious. Scallops cooked and seasoned very well, with a flavourful puree. The shepherd's pie was also very tasty, with tender meat. The Fish and Chips was expectedly good. We asked the wait staff to bring us some Malt Vinegar, and glad that they have it ready. Desserts were a lovely surprise, with the Cannoli nice and crunchy, with a filling that's rich and not overly sweet. The accompanying cherries were also great with the Cannoli.Overall, very happy with the experience, with food that's delightful and yummy, and wait staff that's nice and friendly. It comes with the price though, you will expect to pay a lot for a great experience, as with most really good celebrity chef restaurants. With my wife and daughter, we spent approximately $180. Still, definitely something foodies should try and experience
5
Had the opportunity to book and dine at this restaurant during the busy Jubilee holiday weekend. The ambiance was great. We took the Maitre' D recommendation on the meal course and drinks. Needless to say it was the best meal ever. Would definitely come back. Be sure to make reservation way in advance. You can book online but slots available are always not favorable. Try calling them instead (hard to get thru) to see is there a better time slot/day available
3
We visited BSK due to its Brand. Watched him in Master Chef and had high expectation. The good points : the Location and Ambience is nice. Food is served hot and presented well. On the other side : the Food Quality is Just OK. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing too. Price is on the high side though. Overall: it is worth the experience But I won't go back anytime soon.
5
Had the opportunity to dine at this resteraunt twice while in Singapore. Had the burger both times was amazing. Highly recommend it. Didn't try the wings but while there we saw a number of tables ordering the wings on our second visit so they must do a good wing
5
Went there for the first time today for lunch - we were 4 adults and 5 young kids and we hadn't booked but they managed to squeeze us in. Got a slightly icy reception to begin with as they had to rearrange tables etc, but staff were extremely friendly from then on in - even taking the kids off at one point so they could watch the chef prepare their icecream. Food ranged from very good to excellent - the pork belly was excellent as was the Sunday Roast ( pricey at $45 but the serving was generous )All in all a very good experience and nice that a restaurant of this calibre made a big effort to accommodate families and kids also
1
Mr. Ramsey should kick the chef's behind for serving undercooked cod! Huge shock to me as it happened at this restaurant with his name to it and a price of $44, without side dishes at $10 each (another disappointment). You can understand why I had high expectations. When the manager took it back, he said he'll come back with a better replacement. Guess what? He came back with a smaller cod and I truly believe it was my original dish as I have eaten some potatoes and the replacement dish didn't have as much potatoes as when it was first served. The beef rib burger ($26) was the saving grace but I've had better that cost less. Had a cocktail (Britz  spritz, I think it's called, at $26++) that was bitter but other cocktail (Lady Regent $22++) is much better. Hence, my overall disappointment and I'll most likely not go back again

Had lunch at bread street kitchen recently and tried quite a bit of the food. Overall a good experience but was not overwhelmed. Thought the appetizers were excellent (asparagus with Parma ham and poached egg, the lobster pasta dish, scallops) however weren't that impressed by the mains. The cod was cooked perfectly but lacked any sort of flavor, the fish and chips were good, pork belly was quite bland and the duck breast was good. Out of the desserts, the cheesecake was awesome. The service was good and everyone was very friendly. Would have been nice if there was a set menu available and not only a la carte as we really wanted to try more items. Will be back agai
4
We stopped here for lunch today (Monday) as my friend and I were keen to dine at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.Service staff were great, I ordered the duck breast with potato and my friend ordered the lobster taglione pasta. The duck was delicious, the potato serving was quite small and I would have liked another small serving of the potato. The sauce was also delicious and they provided a small jug with extra sauce in case it was required. My friend loved her taglione and the serving was plentiful.Pricing was a tad on the high side after service and GST was added in - my duck dish was $44.37 whilst my friends pasta as a main serving plus water was around $70.The complimentary bread was fresh, warm and divine to eat.Well worth eating here to try it out
3
During my visit to Singapore my friends had booked dinner at Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant at the casino. Starters and Mains were ordinary. Desserts were not bad. Service nothing to shout about. Although prices are not over the top unlike other celebrity restaurants. Overall disappointing experience!
5
Very affordable pricing against what I expected if you combine Gordon Ramsay and MBS for the same place.Food is not fancy and tasty, it's easy to feel the will to actually serve tasty food ! Definitely not the cheapest option in town but worth it for a special occasion 
4
what a birthday treat to be able to try Chef Ramsay food ... His first restaurant in Singapore.... try it guys ... Happy me!
5
From moment of arrival experience was excellent. Staff were extremely attentive and friendly. Menu was extensive but not too large. Great selection of entrees, mains, desserts and drinks.

Ordered a medium short rib beef burger and received medium rare, Carls jr tasted 10 times better. Lamb shepherd's pie tasted like a $4 street pie. Mash potato were the only winner, tasty, milky, and silky smooth. Dissapointed with Gordon Ramsey

I was in London just a few weeks back and totally missed the chance to catch Gordon Ramsay’s Bread Street Kitchen in the original Bread Street. What a bummer.Luckily, closer to home, the masterchef debut the restaurant in Marina Bay Sands. I was lucky to be able to grab a quick dinner here as I was in Singapore for only a day visit. I would say right off the bat that reservations is almost a must. Mid-week on a Wednesday at 5:30pm, the restaurant was full and a table only available at 9:30pm! As luck would have it, we sat at the bar top next to bar, overlooking the Marina Bay. The decor is modern and the proximity next to the promenade at Marina Bay Sands means you get to enjoy the view and activity while you eat.The menu looks really yummy but what my party had was completely off menu: Gordon Ramsay’s beef wellington, which is a classic British fare. It was superbly delicious.The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side, but would easily be a great choice for classic British meals in the lion city

Booked a table for four about 2 months in advance. When we got to the restaurant there was only one lady on reception who was on the phone. (First problem) We waited for about 5 minutes for her to finish talking to another guest on the phone. When she had finished she then proceeded to get another member of staff to show us to our table. The table was located on the level below which we were escorted to by a lady with blonde hair. We were brought down the main stairwell in which we were brought past the washing up section. (Second problem)When we were finally seated the menus were given to us with no update on any specials or on what's good etc. We were offered water a couple of minutes later. Once we ordered our food and received our starts we overheard what looked like the manager (An American/Canadian lady) telling another table about the special that night which turned out to be Beef Wellington, A Ramsay Special. (Third problem). Nobody had told us about the specials which we definitely would've ordered. Now comes to the food. I ordered the scallops as a starter which was fantastic and the Duck breast as a main which was nice and tender. However, the food seemed to be lacking identity. It seemed to be stuck between being a 'fine dining' meal and a 'gastropub' meal. For instance, another guest at my table ordered the Burger which just came on it's own. It was a decent portion but the other meals that we ordered didn't fit the look that Bread Street seemed to be trying to portray (if they were trying to portray any look at all).My last problem with the evening is dessert. I ordered a special which was a mango pavlova. It wasn't really pavlova but more "Eaton Mess" as it was just Meringue mashed up with some bits of mango. The cheesecake was also ordered which seemed to be the biggest mess up of the whole evening. A sliver of Vanilla Pod was found within the cheesecake. Which when was bitten into created a horrible taste in the mouth. Not what you are expecting from a smooth cheesecake. When asked about it the manager was quick to take it off the bill, but my question is how was it just left within the cheesecake? Evidently a mess up on the kitchen side of things. Overall, I felt that our experience was poor as Bread Street Kitchen didn't seem to have any Identity about it. I couldn't tell if it was a Fine Dining restaurant or simply a Gastropub. Some of the food seemed to be trying to be one of the other. The service was definitely not up to fine dining standards but the prices were definitely towards the more finer dining sides of things. It felt like the brand of the restaurant being "Gordon Ramsay's" was doing all the talking. There was no actual touch that felt you were eating at a famous chef who has won Michelin stars. The food and the service both felt like I was sitting in my local pub in England. Nothing about the restaurant was special nor memorable. I would definitely not go back
3
We waited more than 5 minutes to be seated I ordered a medium well steak it came rare we waited 45 minutes for our dessert we had to call the waiter again to discover that she forgot to inform the chef with our order the rest of the food was good though
4
Staffs were friendly at Bread Street, we arrived around 8.45pm and waited 10mins for the seat (without advance booking). Food were great, order seared scallops , and its melt in your mouth. Garden pea soup for green lovers... myself found it very good.Fish and chips are normal. Tried both rib eye and sirloin, it's the best of the night..

Brand new and after such great experiences at the London West Hollywood by Ramsey I HAD to get in the doors of this one that has opened here. So far, so good. Great location and views from the outdoor bar patio area. Had some really lovely cocktails and started at the top and plan to work my way through the menu. Nice vibes, great design, food was excellent of course. Service was fast and friendly, barkeep was attentive and inventive. Like I said, I will just have to go back to really be able to review adequately

Every element on each dish is cooked well and when eaten together brings out an addition texture and dimension of taste for the dish. Well thought through menu. We look forward to try out more items on the menu.Having watched a few seasons of Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen, we ordered the following dishes:Hot Starters to share: Seared scallops, carrot purée, treacle cures bacon, apple, celery cressMains: Slow-roasted Dingley Pork belly, spiced apple puréeIrish Angus Rib-eye steak 12oz 28 days aged grass fed cooked rare served with Stilton blue cheese sauce on the sideDessert to share:Monkey shoulder Cranachan Cheesecake with roasted balsamic strawberriesTotal bill: under $17

I tried in vain to get a reservation but it being the Jubilee weekend did not help. We wandered by around lunch time and passed the restaurant just as it opened. We had to try our luck and lo and behold we were offered a table for a limited time. It turned out to be a real treat. The dishes seemed simple like shepherd's pie and fish and chips but were so well prepared and tasty. Nothing that we ordered disappointed and the desserts were also excellent. We are really looking forward to going back again on our next trip

Made reservations 1.5 months in advance for a Saturday dinner. Were seated very quickly when arrived, had table with a great view of the skyline. Service was good in general, though I had to request for water to be refilled for the first time. Subsequently, the staff took note and my cup was always filled. Had sushi, asparagus with pancetta and poached egg, Caesar salad and seared scallops as appetizers. The sushi was surprisingly good! Had high expectation for the Poached egg but it was not runny hence it's the only dish that I feel improvement is to be made. The rest were delicious! For the mains, we had pork chop and steak and topped up for an additional half lobster. The lobster was so good and we will definitely be back for more

I popped in there on the off chance with my son and husband on Sunday at lunchtime. We had a good welcome and managed to get in. When given the menu it was hard to choose as there was a good selection of dishes. The service was really good and the staff knew what was on the menu (food and drinks) and were well versed in how things were prepared and cooked and understood the cocktails and wine list. Each of the dishes we had were great in their own way and we really enjoyed them. We landed up ordering lots of starter dishes so we could try lots of different things - tamarind chicken wings, seared scallops, seabass cervice, lobster taglioni and beef brisket (yum). There was a great kids menu and my son loved the fish and chips. We finished off sharing a chocolate fondant which was divine with a cheeky glass of South American rum and spanish sherry! The whole experience was great and they made my son feel very welcome and special. The Bar Manager, William, was really personable and professional and he along with all the other staff who served us made the whole experience really enjoyable. We will definitely return to try the other things on the menu we couldn't fit in this time. Cannot remember the last time I went to a new restaurant in Singapore and had such a good experience

The food here was good and the wine list was quite eclectic.However the staff needs a lot of training as they are simply not up to it.The booking process is torture- you call - you get a message saying the booking process can only take place up to 6 pm (??) Call back 20 minutes later and they tell you "oh we don't know what the recorded message says that".Eventually you book and then turn up and get to stand in a queue while the one greeter negotiates with a casual walk in customer who cannot decide. Then you are shown to a table where the sun blazes onto it and the whole experience is uncomfortable - can we not run to some kind of blind or window tint? The staff's answer - "Oh just wait it will be better in about 20 minutes".The ordering wasn't bad but - absolutely zero enthusiasm or recommendation.I recalled a recent Gordon Ramsay Nightmare show where he ridiculed some "oik" Brits on one of the Spanish Costas -who "had no clue about customer service" - particularly front of house and how to promote the food and the menu. Well actually you don't have to travel to Spain it’s alive and well at Bread Street Kitchen.The cocktails were overpriced and disappointingly served. Particularly the Cosmopolitan it looked like a giant leaf had fallen into a sundae dish.The wine was brought and without ceremony dumped in the ice bucket and at no stage did I get to taste it.The starters - sea bass Carpaccio and the scallops were OK the scallops slightly overcooked.The main course - the black cod and the pork chop were quite good and reasonably cooked. the side order of mashed potato was over salty and over mashed (the crushed potato on the cod was a much nicer texture). The Hungarian Tokaji an unusual entry on local wine lists and was reasonable.The starter plates were whisked away and the main course cutlery then just dumped on the table. The cutlery looks cheap and nasty by the way.Now a handy hint for the staff - if a patron puts their cutlery leaning on the plate - knife and fork to left and right, they are still eating - stop trying to take the plates away. Most diners will put knife and fork together at a slight angle on the plate to indicate completion.Also wait staff please keep an eye on your diners and don't have them ask (not once but twice) for wine top ups.Seems like the cooking staff have the idea - and the food was quite tasty - the waiting and front of house staff - dear me no

It was a bit difficult to get a table at this restaurant. Around 19.00 we came here and they told us it was really busy and we could get back in around 1,5 hour. We walked around for half and hour and thougt let's give it another shot and get a drink at the bar. This time somebody else welcomed us and told us we could sit outside. A bit strange.The rest of the night everything was perfect. The service was great. We had the best risotto we ever had and the dessert was also really nice. It was an expensive dinner, but totally worth it
3
On arriving and asking for a table of one, I was given a choice of the bench at the window or the bar, so no table for one. Hmmm. The bread arrived, yes, not bad. The barman was superb. Knew his business and was very welcoming and interested. So out comes my choice on the menu, Pork Belly. Two strips of Pork Belly, 5 mm thick, and a small spread of 'sauce'. For the price, the addition of a small baked potato and a sprig of asparagus would have made the cost easier to swallow. The side of fries, well..better in a country town cafe and a quarter of the price.The crystal glassware might be swank, but seriously, this came across as a 'trade on the name' restaurant and will not be returning
3
Went there to have a drink with a friend and ended up having dinner. the wine by the glass was extremely expensive in my opinion. around $20 for a glass of regular table wine. the service was friendly enough, the food was good but the portion very tiny, they probably served us the smallest fish and chips i have ever seen in my life.i will maybe be back for a quick bite but not for dinner

BST is a revelation. I highly recommend it to you. You never know what to expect from mid range bistro type restaurants by fine dining chefs but Gordon Ramsay has hit the nail on the head with BST. Even my sceptical guest and no Ramsay lover complimented both his very tasty G&T and the food.I especially loved the shepherds pie which was the best I have tasted in Singapore, full of flavour. The chicken bang bang was out of the this world, the tuna tartae very tasty and banana sticky toffee pudding was stunning.The service was very good, the sommelier I knew from DB Modern and he was spot on to help choose some nice wine to compliment the meal. The rest of the service staff were attentive and helpful.All round wonderful dining experience, others may disagree but taste the food and enjoy the experience, explore their cocktails and wines and have some fun and you'll come away with a very positive impression.

Chose to visit here due it being Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.The menu wasnt that extensive and it was full of British classics.My other half ordered the burger and i ordered the fish and chips. The food was ok not outstanding ive had better at my local chip shop. I was expecting something a little bit more for the price. Otherwise the restaurant was lovely and good view looking over the qua

~2nd time on an August Sunday with family & AGAIN without a prior reservation, my son had looked online and there were none available till October!!!~I walked on up about 11am and asked the really polite maître when I asked for a table for 4 inside she quickly said she'd prolly be able to fit us in, a few minutes later she told me we could stay 1.15mins which was more than enough time for a Singaporean lunch :)~This time we ordered someone old & something new1. Tagliolini - expecting the same as we'd been served, this time the pasta was soft, the taste was watery, bland & somewhat bitter. The manager did change the dish but the 2nd one tasted the same (won't order this again)2. Shepard's Pie - a nicely crusted top with chunky cubes of lamb hidden inside, a bit watery and the taste was not as strong or flavorful (won't order this again)3. Traditional Fish & Chips - OMG YES this simply prepared dish had great taste, superior batter, crushed peas that were a great compliment :) YUMz4. Seasonal British Cheeses - the oat cake cookies were sweet with chutney that were sweet (liked both), ate all the selection except blue cheese (will reorder)5. Banana sticky toffee pudding - very good, very sweet~This time a bottle of plain water was brought out and served "Free"!~Bread Basket was so tasty we had 2 rounds with butter :)~Mashed Potato side need not have been ordered, it was a substantial side, creamy and smooth, just the right way to serve it :)I can't wait to get back, take a look at photos & the menu :

Average food, great view and I will definitely not be going back. There are loads of other restaurants in Singapore where you can get just as good run-of-the-mill food. If you walk in with no expectations and forget Gordon Ramsay owns the restaurant, you will not be disappointed. I think our Eastern European blond waiter deserves a special mention. We had planned on sharing a few starters instead of ordering a main each and were not sure how many appetizers to order. Some restaurants are quite generous with their appetizers whilst others are not. When asked about portion size for the starters, the blond waiter replied that they were not as big as the main courses. A most helpful and informed guy. I can't help but wonder what Gordon Ramsay's reaction would be in a similar situation

Big fan of Gordon Ramsay (following his MasterChef US series & Hell's Kitchen) so just had to try this place!
Read more here: https://jayellesays.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/gordon-ramsays-bread-street-kitchen-singapore-mbs/
The best dish of all the dishes ordered was Spicy tuna tartare, chilli, garlic, sesame oil, wonton crisps ($19).

I really like this restaurant, from their service, to their drinks, food and ambience. We couldn't secure a reservation online, so tried out luck and got seats at the bar. Our virgin cocktails were tasty. Service was good. We didn't feel ignored at the bar. Food was fabulous - try their risotto and pork belly for mains! I have some dietary restrictions and they were able to accommodate even though we didn't have a reservation. I was very impressed. The ambience of the restaurant was excellent. A cool summer day, overlooking marina bay sands. Truly lovely. I would recommend to my friends

Background-Gordon Ramsay's (famous celebrity chef) first restaurant in Singapore. The wife and I are big fans of GR and recently dined at his eponymous restaurant in London. Food-Generally palatable but Irish Angus Rib-eye Steak 12oz 28 Days Aged Grass Fed ($68++) was good; done to an almost perfect medium rare, lightly salted, tender with bits of chewy fat and full of juicy flavour. Pricing-Rather expensive given the "informal/casual" labeling of the restaurant. We spent ~$170 for 2 on lunch excluding wine. For pictures, see http://www.timelessfacade.com/2015/06/bread-street-kitchen-gordon-ramsays.htm

Went for lunch for expecting amazing food and service, but not. The blonde girl front office was the most unfriendly person, not very welcome at all. Place is so noise and not nice atmosphere.The waiter we had was just ok. Staff need urgent a better service training.The food:i order for entree the Spice tuna which was not bad, but not great or amazing. The Mocktail was nice. For main i order the Cod fish, was so bland, just horrible. My partner order the pea soup, was tasteless and for the main shepherds pie, was good!I don't recommend this place, its busy and hard get reservation because the name of Gordon Ramsay, but not worth. Marina Bay Sands have much better place to enjoy great meal, better atmosphere and better service with friendly staff like ADRIFT restaurant

We as a family have decided to come back and give this place another try and have a go at other dishes. It's very disappointing that despite the reservation made a week ago, the restaurant still couldn't find us a table immediately when it should've already been prepared and ready for the customer. The lady at the front desk was overwhelmed with customers streaming in which left many waiting outside, including us. And the worst part, she forgot about our table! I had to go back in and remind her again, then only we were brought to our table finally after 10 minutes of waiting outside the restaurant. That aside, we were finally seated at the basement level and the seat was perfect! A great view of the kitchen and it was a joy watching the chefs work. Our server was polite and provided very good service. The food came really quickly as well. We had the Scallops, Risotto, Sea Bream and Fish&Chips. Scallops cooked beautifully, risotto perfect! Sea Bream slightly on the salty side, fish and chips average but acceptable for the price. We had some ice cream for desserts and were very satisfied. Service was quick and attentive, bill came quickly. Overall, a very good improvement from the previous visit. The food may not blow your minds but it is acceptable considering the price and the fact that it's a casual dining restaurant. We will definitely be back, probably next month, as Gordon's famous Beef Wellington will be on the menu!!!

I visited with my family, two kids 5 & 3 they were made special getting their own little pack with kids menu, chefs hat and colouring book with pencil. All the food was fresh and enjoyable. Prices like you would pay back home in Australia. I would return.

While planning our recent trip to Singapore, I just had to include a visit to Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen, which had only been open at the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex for three weeks.We booked online for lunch prior to leaving Australia and our booking was confirmed via email – it really was that simple!When we arrived a little early at BSK, we were greeted by friendly staff and only had to wait a few minutes in the bar area before being seated. There were five in our party: four adults and our eight-year-old son.BSK has two levels; we were on level one, and looked out the large floor-to-ceiling windows. A lovely sight for our long lunch! The restaurant has an industrial warehouse design with black and metal dominating the space, offset by wood and caged light bulbs.I was pleased to see they catered for children, with a kids' menu and kids' pack including a chef's hat, colouring-in book and pencils. They kept our son busy.The menu looked delicious! The kitchen staff of 27 is headed by Executive Chef Sabrina Stillhart, who previously worked at the original London Bread Street Kitchen and has been with Ramsay for near a decade.We received a complimentary breadbasket of crackers, bread sticks, focaccia and bun, served with a slab of genuine salted butter. There was a good mixture of textures to nibble on while we talked and waiting for our first course. For entrée we tried three dishes: seared scallops with carrot puree, treacle-cured bacon, apple, and celery cress; tamarind-spiced chicken wings with spring onions and coriander; and our son had chicken wings with bbq sauce.The scallops were plump and nicely caramelised, with a scraping of sweet carrot puree. The smoky salty bacon on top was a nice contrast to the sweetness and crispness of apple on top. An absolutely beautiful dish.The tamarind spiced chicken wings were tart and spicy but very soft to eat. And you just had to use your hands! At least a moist hand wipe was supplied to clean up afterwards!Unfortunately our son didn't enjoy his kids' chicken wings with bbq sauce, so we ended up sharing them. The sauce was sickly sweet and the flavour was overpowering, not really fun or pleasant to taste at all. He ended up finishing off the scallops, much to our disgust!For main course we again tried three different dishes: slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly with spiced apple puree; roasted sea trout with summer vegetables, Lala clams, and aromatic broth; and our son had the kids' fish and chips.The pork was soft and tender with a crispy crackling on top. The spiced apple puree was accompanied with diced apple pieces. The spices weren't too overpowering , just enough to add a savoury note to the sweetness of the apple. The jus was served separately allowing the diner to control how much to pour onto the plate.The roasted sea trout had a lovely crisp skin and was still translucent in the middle. The broth, including the summer vegetables and clams, was light, perfectly seasoned and full of flavour. A wonderfully balanced broth.The kids' fish and chips came with smashed peas. Our son loved this dish – but I was too absorbed in my main course and didn't try it.We also ordered a side of mashed potato, which was silky and seasoned well. We didn't want to fill up on sides as we wanted to keep some room for dessert.And for dessert… chocolate fondant with salted caramel and mint chocolate chip ice cream – very rich but at least the ice cream cut through a little; Monkey Shoulder (Scotch whisky) Cranachan cheesecake with roasted balsamic strawberries, which was light and the strawberries full of flavour; coffee and white chocolate parfait with poached blackberries. Coffee is my favourite and this was perfectly balanced; banana sticky toffee pudding, muscavado caramel, clotted cream – it was a bit much! And our son had ice cream with honeycomb and Oreos! Perfectly kid-like.The service was excellent, with out waiter friendly and chatty but not over the top. Our three courses came out in good time and the atmosphere was relaxed for a lunch-time sitting.I was expecting to be blown away, as this is one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. And while it didn't have that effect on me, it certainly was an enjoyable and memorable experience with some fabulous dishes. If you're heading to Singapore for business or pleasure, it's worth making a booking

Restaurant : The Bread Street KitchenAmbience :Airy, noisy like a cafe. With a good expansive view of the waters.Service :Very good and dedicated service. Friendly and knowledgeable.Food :The bread was really good. The assortment of breads was hot off the oven. Fragrant, multigrain, baguette etc. Yummy.1) Seared scallops was good. Topped with apple slices and bacon, good start.2) Salted beef was average. Nothing outstanding. We did not finish.3) Fish and chips. The chips was really good, a high British standard. The fish was firm with a fine crispy batter. 4) Pork belly is amazing. The crust was very very well done. Aromatic and hampion of the menu.5) Pork chop is juicy and succulent.6) Tuna in spicy sauce was just average7) Black cod was only so-so.8) Deserts we ordered the cheesecake, the pineapple carpaccio and the choc fondant with mint chip ice-cream. The fondant was the standout winner. The rest passable.Conclusion :The restaurant is said to be fully booked for lunch and dinner for the next 3 mths. But we see still a fair bit of empty tables and people can just walk in. A lot of it prob due to Gordon Ramsay's fame. A good meal but would need to order the right food. Not all are of the michelin std

Recommended the beef Wellington which was a special. A good portion for two to share with side of kailan, carrots and mashed potatoes. Loved the beef+pastry puff and deliciously sweet carrots. The oversalted watercress salad was the only disappointment. their cocktails were delicious; Lady Regent a mix of Hendricks, lime, elderflower, etc with cucumber. Finished off with dessert of chocolate fondant with salted caramel and mint chocolate chip ice cream. A good meal but not great. Service however was spot on

Four of us went there for dinner last night but left feeling nothing but 'that was very ordinary'. We ordered the lobster, scallops, chicken wings and chicken watercress salad for starters and only the watercress salad is worth mentioning. The scallops were so bland and the other two are just better forgotten. We then had the pork chop, shepherds pie, black cod and duck for our mains and again only the shepherds pie was good. My duck was extremely tough and the pea sauce just did not go well with it but the berry sauce was somewhat a savior. The fish was ordinary as was the pork chop. The pie however did have good seasoning and the ratio of potato to minced lamb was really good. Thankfully the meal was saved by their deserts. We ordered the chocolates fondant, cheesecake, canoli and banana toffee pudding. Everything was good and kind of saved the meal. Service was absolutely mediocre. The waiter cleared 3 of our plates while my friend was still busy eating his pork and actually started wiping the table while he was eating. He also opened our wine bottle and was serving us when he suddenly turned his attention to the table next to us and we had to call someone else to come take our meal orders. Anyhow for 500 bucks it was just not worth it and we felt we were paying for a name rather than quality!!

Went on a weekday for lunch at around 2, didn't have a reservation, but was seated immediately. Must be my lucky day having heard some from some friends that the wait time could be long. Hostess was quite friendly, very good first impression.We ordered portions of fish n chips and the BSK burger and they tasted good. No complains about them. We also ordered a blueberry pie which was the special of the day. Not really a fan of fruit tarts, but this pie really tasted awesome. My dinning mates agreed on that too.This is a cafe and not a fine dinning restaurant, hence service may be found wanting at times, but I'm not complaining. Overall, a good dinning experience. Would definetly go back for the food as long as queues are not excessive

I agree with the other reviews here, the service is pretty bad considering the price of the restaurant. We were not even offered a drink - I had to ask for one. The food was fine but just fine, nothing fantastic - however one glass of wine, one glass of beer, water for the kids and 4 main courses which were just okay was $250 SD. Gordon Ramsay needs to step up his game with this or sort out the service at least. I know that Singapore restaurants are expensive and am happy to pay for good service but this was not that at all
4
My fourth visit since opening, it's near the office so I go for Friday lunch and also my wife and baby at weekends, it's one of the things I like about this place, relaxed and family friendly with excellent food but equally good for business. And the location is first class. I normally have the fish dishes which have so far all been excellent apart from the trout which was over cooked but in a delicious broth do I could forgive that and the maki rolls which were so so. For the meat dishes shepherds pie is to die for! They have a good wine list too. This will continue to be a firm favourite

Finally I am able to put a name for all the earlier complain reviews that I read about the service of this restaurant. Jenna is her name ! We were greeted by Eliza & she was courteous & friendly all the way until we get our table (she even fix 2 tables into 1 for our convenient). Even though we waited for an hour to get table, it is not her fault since I knew Gordon Ramsay restaurant is always full. But all the waiting was worth it as she was all smiles & friendly unlike her colleague Jenna where when we asked she just said "still waiting" & when we finally asked "how long", Jenna said if we were served by Eliza then we should asked her !I felt we were in a episode of Kitchen Nightmares !Thank God the food were quite decent. We ordered BSK short rib beef burger (ok but I was hoping for a bit more gusto because it's listed with spicy sriracha mayo), Dingley Dell pork belly (nice even though Crystal Jade pork is better) & fish & chips (a lot of reviews put it as this restaurant best food so I try it and it was ok)We also ordered 3 salads : Caesar salad (ordinary) , Alaskan King Crab with apple cocktail + pink peppercorns (unique) & red cabbage salad.All the above foods were recommended by Mr Jonathan who did an exceptional job for serving us. By the way all the waiters that we encountered were all very courteous & friendly like Eliza.I just felt that Jenna is really rude especially when we have to wait for 1 hour she could at least be courteous like Eliza & the rest of the waiters.I know I mention Eliza a lot (I have no crush on her by the way even though she's beautiful) but she was professional as the rest of the receptionist in the other competing celebrity restaurant such as Cut by Wolfgang Puck, db by Daniel Boulud, Mozza by Mario Batali & Waku Ghin (my all time favorite) by Tetsuya Wakuda.Eliza should replace Jenna, Mr Gordon

Whilst the food was nice, the service was exceptionally poor. We ordered three courses (4 people) plus cocktails and wine. We had more than a few mix ups in our orders and there seemed to be no designated service staff for our table. The entrees were the star of the menu. All mains were a little boring on the plate, but delicious. The dessert - Eton Mess was more mess than a dessert, tiny bits of meringue and mostly a glass of whipped cream. Overall it was an average dining experience

Our niece treated us to lunch here. We enjoyed the food, especially the appetisers. They were well executed, composed and presented. However, we felt that the pricing was at least 30% overpriced.The ambience and settings veered towards utilitarian. We could appreciate simplicity but some quiet elegance and flair would have been more appealing. Indeed, it would have been expected at this price point.Now let's get to the heart of our review - the appalling and dismal service. One wait staff dropped a plate of food next to our niece. The food and especially the sauces splattered all over. Enough went into our niece's hand bag which was left opened. It soiled both her hand bag and its contents. The careless and callous waiter was both unapologetic and almost nonchalant about the incident. Obviously he didn't bother to check if any diner or their belongings were soiled.Our wait staff was cold, stiff and unpersonable. She didn't exude a welcoming persona. Isn't the F&B industry all about service and personality besides just food and beverage?Our last disgust was the extremely long wait, about 15 minutes, for our cheque. When it finally arrived after several requests and follow up, there was further confusion as we were presented with two cheques at one instance and a cheque without our credit card in another instance. That certainly left a bad and long lasting after taste in our mouth. We simply couldn't fathom why or how a request for a cheque could be such an ordeal and complicating matter. Perhaps Gordon Ramsay would care to enlighten us

Just had dinner here, party of 3. Though we were the second seating, there was still a crowd plus there were still more diners coming in when we left!The seared scallops and tamarind wings were nice! But the Alaskan king crab salad was too salty. Fish & Chips was well done, though a tad oily. And the mush/crushed peas were a bit bland. We were split between the pork belly though - i liked both the spiced apple puree and the sauce that came with it but wasn't to my friends' liking.Service was good, though securing a reservation took some effort (emails and calls were unanswered. I happened to be around the area so dropped by to book in person!). I also felt there was insufficient lighting and the music was too loud.Yes i admit it is pricey but do take into consideration the brand, location and labour cost. I highly doubt one would return often, perhaps only for special occasions

We attended Bread Street Kitchen Singapore for lunch. Service was excellent. Staff were well drilled and attentive. We had a German waiter who was excellent.The space is a blend of modern meets traditional British pub. I liked the ambience and the vibe.For starters we had a Tuna Tartare and a Salted Brisket. The tuna was good quality and paired with a high quality creme fraiche. The menu said spicy however I found I was searching for some more spice, or in fact some hit of chilli. It was a quality dish but that was restrained too much. Show some balls and put some heat in it to elevate the dish to another level. Oh and in the theme of the day in my opinion it was under seasoned.The beef was tasty with a delicious piccalilli but again lacked a wow factor. It didn't pop in your mouth and was under seasoned.For one main we had a steamed sea bream with braised leeks, razor clam, samphire and shellfish dressing. Everything on the plate was cooked to perfection but again the dish lacked a wow factor and was under seasoned. It was good but it wouldn't drag you back to eat there again on it's own.Our other main was Roasted Duck Breast with Boulangere Potatoes, Puree'd Cabbage and mulled berries sauce. The duck was good if not just a touch tough (being picky here) and the potatoes were a delight. The cabbage puree was a bit weird and the mulled berries sauce was a great match for the sauce. Again some seasoning would be nice.At this point we saw a kids meal of two mini slider burgers go past and as we had been tossing up between the fish and a burger asked our waiter if we could have one to share to try the burgers. I have been in many restaurants that refuse to serve adults kids meals so I saw this a test. It was no problem and very quickly the burgers appeared with some chips. These were fantastic. Delicious beefy flavour from the medium cooked patty and great tasty cheese. It could use a touch of sauce but they were great. The chips were your run of the mill frozen variety but cooked superbly. I would rather have house made chips but it was a kids meal.Desserts were a chocolate fondant and the banana sticky date pudding. Both well cooked and both not pushing any boundaries.Overall we enjoyed Bread Street Kitchen. It is expensive for what it is though. The food is beautifully cooked but has a feeling of being 'safe' and not providing anything you haven't seen before. The service is great and you will have an experience you enjoy. It is somewhat ironic to me that watching Gordon Ramsay absolutely slay people on his show's for not seasoning food that we found every dish lacked seasoning and none was provided on the table

So the family was at MBS and got turned off by the dragon snake of a queue to get into the Art Science Museum, we settled for an early 5pm dinner at Bread Street instead... Got seated quite promptly, kudos to the Eastern European looking hostess. We had the choice picks from the grill - Irish ribeye, fish & chips, lamb chops and chicken - the food was generally okay. It's not fantastic for the premium that you pay for. Service and wait staff could be better - we had a waiter dragging table screeching across the floor and perhaps a tad too enthusiastic about tapping the dirt out of the table top too...draught Pilsner tastes like local tiger beer cra

It looks like any modern eatery in any modern city with a bit of this and that, without much definitive cuisine although it's supposed to be British.It was a busy Saturday late afternoon and the place was packed. Two very pretty blondes greet guests at the door although one can enter from the other side as it opens fully to the promenade, overlooking Marina Bay.We sat at the bar with our backs facing the promenade because of the crowd. Beers ordered, we ordered the slow roasted pork belly. Moments later, two thin slices of pork belly arrived. The flavour was decent, with a very crispy skin but I expected more on a bare plate, particularly at $28.We soon noticed a few vacated seats facing the promenade and requested if we could shift. The waitress apparently went away to check and left us waiting without coming back. We then asked another staff and she mentioned she had to check with the manager, and with the same result. Finally we got hold of the manager and after some discussing, he relented and accommodated us.Initial service was acceptable with the young sommelier being helpful with wine recommendations. Soon after, we were left alone with our empty beer mugs and used cutlery and napkins left at the table, even when wait staff would come and top up our wine. We were recommended the seared scallops to go with our rosé and very quickly, the scallops appeared, all three or them for $24. It looked pretty and well presented until we took our first bite. The immediate fishy scent took hold and had it returned. Much later the manager asked how the scallops were and when I said that it was not nice, he replied with a "Thank you very much". What??? We also had an Irish black angus ribeye for $68 and it came almost medium although I asked for medium rare and the meat was too lean and a touch tough, even for grass fed beef. I could do better at home with better quality cut and much, much cheaper too. By that time, we were too disappointed and no longer interested to complain.For such a fare and one that has Gordon Ramsay's name to it, it was utterly disappointing. Superficially, it looked good but...One could understand that the staff may be busy at that busy time but mind you, we were there for a few hours and things were only cleared when we asked them to. Ultimately, it felt like a well dressed up little café with glitter and glam but still falling short on the basics. One of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares? Perhaps not but it was not a pleasant dream.We later proceeded to Mozza downstairs and had a much better time and the standards are ostensibly much higher. What were you thinking, Gordon Ramsay

I was a Friday night walk in and warmly received and accommodated by the staff. Food was very good- nice ceasar salad made with real anchovy filets followed by the short rib burger- washed down with 2 pints of cider. Delicious!

perhaps the busiest night of the year and no reservation,however William and is staff could not of been more accomodating.The service was slick and quick considering the crowd.If you want Gordon's fine dining then this is not for you.He has created some classic English dishes with a pan Asian theme,it will take us a few more visits to do the menu some more justice.Just what Singapore needed.We will be back soon.John & Sharon Global food travellers.New Zealan

I was hoping this place gets better after some time of opening. Guess what, It got worse. Ordered Well cooked Hamburger but given medium rare. Not sure if the chef is trained... Who eats hamburger with blood? Service staff seams to be getting better. As my first post says, there are too many caucasian 'managers' who are not hands on but asking others carry out the job. Basically they are the messenger.. Come on, it's F&B business. Learn how to smile and get tone stop service. Overall, I will not go back anymore

The starters , a) the spicy tuna tartar ($19) was prepared well and had just the right amount of chili and sesame oil so as to not overpower the subtle tuna flavor b) Alaskan King crab and apple cocktail with pink peppercorn salad ($28) , while a bit on the watery ( and expensive) side, the Crab itself was tasty c) the Cesar Salad ($19)not only looked picture perfect but the dressing , which I've disccoverd can be hit or miss in Singapore, was just perfect . Nothing beats a well executed Cesar to get dinner off to a flying start But, after a fantastic start to service and expectations running high , things started to derail . My wife ordered the Roasted Black Cod ($44), while I had theI Irish Angus Rib-eye Steak 12oz 28 Days Aged Grass Fed ($68 ). The Cod was totally uninspiring in appearance , lacked seasoning to enhance the subtle taste and was bordering on overdone. ON the flip side, my Steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare ,however the Grill Chef was far too heavy handed with the salt and ruined a fantastic cut of beef . . Given the fact I returned 8 oz I was surprised no re fire or comp was offered and thankfully I didn't order the 24 oz CÃ´te de boeuf @ $ 180 as if that came over seasoned I would have raised a stink. Drinks , I had a delicious Meantime Pilsner that was served in a Chilled Pewter Mug ($20) a Glass of French Red ($28 .) Also, one I still and on sparkling water ($18.00)Service was good given the busy Saturday SG50 Very much on the fence if I would return again ; too bad as it could have made a nice local dining option

Arrived around 7.30 on a Monday evening to be told they had no availability. After some chatting with the staff and advising them we were going home the next day they said to wait a bit. I was prepared to split our party of 6 up but after a few minutes we were escorted to a table downstairs. Our waitress was excellent and very helpful to my mum who eats gluten free. Our food was very enjoyable. We had steak, duck, chicken and fish & chips. All the food was nicely presented and the deserts we had were delicious. If we return to Singapore a visit to Bread Street Kitchen would be on our list of restaurants to experience. Only thing I would definitely book in advance
2
Location is nice - although we were seated in the basement so no view of the bay. Strange that when you arrive (and you have a table downstairs) you have to leave the restaurant, head down the escalator and re-enter. Anyway...We had lunch, mains only...Bread and butter was excellent. Burger and chips were nice (although you have to pay for chips separately) so nearly $40 for a burger and chips. You can walk down the hall and have a burger with foie gras on top for only marginally more. Shepherd's Pie was tasty (beef inside was best part) although REALLY expensive. $38 and it didn't come with any veg, salad or chips. Unfortunately the fish & chips were a disaster. The first plate came out and was not cooked (it was an unusually large piece of fish). It was sent back and the next one was overcooked and laden in grease. Needless to say I didn't eat it. Mushy peas were very tasty! The cost of the fish & chips was removed from my bill and the wait staff were very gracious in dealing with the issue. I enjoyed the wine, bread/butter and mushy peas most of all. The prices are expensive (more so than some of the other MBS restaurants of equal quality) and I wasn't blown away by the quality of the food. Food standards are high in Singapore and I just couldn't recommend this to anyone when there are so many high quality, better priced options
3
We ordered the fish and chips, costs $22 and just a tiny piece of fillet. The cold linguini starter costs $28. The only thing i like is the ambience, you sit facing the bay and singapore skyline

The best food experience in Singapore. Bread Street is no doubt exclusive and exquisite but the value for money is incredible. Go for the Pork belly, Shephard Pie and Dessert Menu.There's no limit to what they'll prepare for you. The waiters are also amazing, our waiter made sure we had everything we needed at all times. Restaurant Manager MANU and and assistant manager Jenna made sure our experience was nothing but perfect. Will come back for sure...when I back in marina bay Sands

We did not make a reservation BUT it was already 9.40pm. We were informed there was a 20 minute wait. This went on to become a 40 minute wait. When we got a table, there were many tables available and we were appalled to hear that they were short of wait staff or that they could not accommodate (which should have been informed to us). While on the wait list, we did enquire about the wait for the food. We were informed that the food is quick. Food was not served in order. Mains came first. They forgot our chicken wings. And didn't even realize it. When we asked, our server mentioned the food went to the wrong table. Asked for the manager and some how the manager was not informed. Coincidentally he came to the table. And told him about it. Instead of an apology I got a "this is casual dining" MOZZA is way better. Gordon Ramsey: perhaps we are not up to your standards but there is no need for this. NOT WORTH IT.

Had two visits to bsk in one week and both times it was excellent. Attentive staff and quick service. Food is heavily European influenced but executed to perfection - scallops and beef brisket are highlights. We took our daughter on the 2nd visit and the front of house was excellent and made a real effort with our daughter. Yes it can be hard to get a table but that is a good thing
5
Fantastic burger. Difficult to get a reservation, but the amazing assistant manager, Jenna, got us in. Good vibe, nice staff, and an amazing burger. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Very casual dining, but very awesome food.
5
Had an amazing experience ... Amazing food ... The wow factor...a must visit restaurant in Singapore at affordable price ..
3
It was quite disappointing when you have to wait for an hour to be seated even you have a reservation that is made one month ago...
Mains were great but the Monkey Shoulder Cheesecake wasn't my favourite..
2
Service was not good, don't understand why we ordered lamb chop and we got black cod instead, the waiter is a Caucasian guy, not very happy when he was taking our order, maybe he thinks he is too good to serve Asian? Food is nothing to sing about. Won't bother to go back again.
3
went here for dessert and its just average (some of it) we tried their homemade ice cream and their chocolate canoli (i forget the name actually)the ice cream is badddd! just a typical home made ice cream that you can find in hawkers, really! and the ice cream is not in the menu because they said that its a special menu for celebrating their first month. the only selling point is it comes with many toppings. the chocolate canoli says gordon ramsay on it! we really- really enjoyed it.... its a fried canoli stuffed with cream cheese and white chocolate with pistachio toppings and dark cherry, absolutely delight.... its a bit pricey but worth the price (sgd18 for this
2
Difficult to get a reservation or even to contact the restaurant to get a reservation - called several times to get a voicemail and sent an email as well. Received a call back much later from a poorly trained person. Staff wasn't friendly when we arrived, service was slow and unattentive - didn't ever receive a beer i ordered but it was included on the bill (sorted that out after 15 minutes of discussion with the staff). Food was mediocre at best. We had the Salmon Ceviche, risotto, hamburger and mac n' cheese...definitely not going back. ever
5
We walked in without any booking but was assisted by a staff who gave us a table with a great view. Food tasted excellent and was served on time. We had Shepard pie which was wonderful. I highly recommended it. Sheppy cider which was served in a metal tankard. Since I have sweet tooth, we tried monkey shoulder for our desert. It's truly heaven for sweet lovers. Overall I am happy with my visit to bread street kitchen and looking forward to have another meal soon.

Meal: Ordered the Californian maki, flatbread, pork belly, fondant and dessert of the day. Loved the pork belly which went really well with the apples and sauce. Melt in your mouth goodness and definitely worth the calories. husband loved the maki which came with fresh crabs and avocado. I thought the flatbread was a pleasant surprise with its different elements that went v well together. Chocolate fondant was decadent but just a tad too sweet. In general delicious food but portions were small.Service: very good service I have to say. Waiters were fast to change our utensils and it wasn't tough to get their attention. But we realize at the end of our meal that we didn't receive the bread basket that was suppose to be given to every table. Atmosphere: very chic decor and wonderful view if you sit facing the promenade. Diners are generally well mannered and although it was packed, I did not feel that it was overly crowded. Also not too noisy to have a decent conversation with your companion. All in all I had a good time and would be back again to try other dishes but probably not very soon. Disclaimer I went during a non peak hour which probably helped in terms of service
3
So there are two floors to the restaurant. We came on a Saturday night at 10.30pm and it was completely full. Ask to sit upstairs because it is nicer. There is this al fresco area which is more bar like and suitable for drinks but it feels nice to spill over into the promenade. The music flows out from the bar area and the atmosphere is pretty chill. And they are willing to serve dinner there even though its suppose to be more of a drinks area. We ordered drinks, appetizers and dessert. The appetizers were good. I liked the cured salmon the best. Unfortunately for the other appetizer dishes - I have had better at cheaper less well-known restaurants. Desserts - even more forgettable. Summary - average food. Nice atmosphere. Would come again if in the area - but not otherwise

You will fall into one of two camps when it comes to outdoor seating in Singaporean restaurants - one you will love being in the open or two, you will loathe it. I fall into the latter camp. Walked into BSK early evening & was shown a shared table on the side of the street level. For my money this is tantamount to being sent to Siberia as the attention you get will be minimal. I was wedged between an American couple whose wife's nasal voice grated on me as their conversation got a little too loud. On the other end, a couple of tourists from Mainland China who also felt it was ok to speak in the upper registers of the decibel scale. A little later they sat two Americans working in Singapore in front of me & for the whole time they were there griped about costs of living locally. Hey, I totally get that when you are seated at a shared table, this sort of thing happens but for my money, if seated here ask to be seated inside the main restaurant where it is cool & air conditioned.Which leads to the question of how good is the food, given that this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. At best I would say it is ok, no complaints but there wasn't anything memorable about the dishes I ordered. Salmon ceviche was ok but at the end of the day, it was just slivers of fish in a citrus dressing. Not exactly rocket science. I tried a salad of Bang Bang chicken which is a kind of east meets west kind of dish. Again it was ok with the first few mouthfuls being pleasant enough. For the main there was the chef's version of shepherd's pie made of braised lamb and carrots, topped with mash & brioche crumbs. In a comfort food sort of way it worked but at this level of the game, it wasn't a blow your socks off dish. Dessert was a Scottish cheesecake with marinated strawberries & probably the best part of the meal.Service was really non existent as I had to waive down a waitress to place my order and between the appetiser and main, the wait was more than 25 minutes. The waitress did come by to apologise but really I had expected the service to be more attentive. While not at the stratosphere of fine dining temples but at least decent service to ensure the customer had a good time.At the end of it all, it was a mixed experience, let down by the table and the service. Server also didn't seem to understand the term ceviche even though it was on the menu. I am unsure as to whether I would go back again. But ultimately the diner has to judge

delicious was the word i used to describe the food here. they are so fast in preparing it that i was happy. they have a lot of types of food and the waiters are proper and fast. thanks for serving me.

Its extremely important when posting a review that one is fair, honest and respectful, as I completely understand running operations like these can be costly and complex at the best of times.We were recently in Singapore and decided to see if we could get a table at Bread Street Kitchen, however we were advised there was a two month waiting list.I spoke with our hotel butler and asked him to see if he could get a table for either that night or the next. He contacted me back and said he had managed to get a table for that night. Given all the hype about the restaurant we were naturally excited to be getting a table, so we were looking forward to 6:00pm.On arrival we were ushered up stairs, the view was spectacular to say the least, a great start to the evening. The food was nice, portion sizes a little light on, however there was no wow factor, the only wow factor came when i got the bill. We had three beers, two cool drinks, two entrees, four mains and two deserts, all for S$478.00, yes S$478.00. I definitely would have not minded the cost if there was at least someone on my table who commented, WOW the food was fantastic, I would have at least felt I got some value for money, not just a great view with our dinner. I guess with an owner with such a high profile our expectation was equally as high, instead we left feeling disappointed and short changed.My wife did read some of the reviews prior to deciding to get a table, however we still decided to give it a go, as we know food can be very subjective. However now we have personally experienced it for ourselves, I feel a lot of the comments are fair and accurate. I do hope they address the issues raised by customers
2
We go for dinner and we left puzzled.Food a bit disappointed. Is definetly not bad but the same food can be found at different outlet in Singapore and execute in better way. Fish for the fish and chips was smashy and scallop overcook. Service a bit lose but again not bad.I will wait to settle and give another try in future
2
Pretty disappointing for me. I'm a fan of Gordon however I think the foods here just doesn't lived up to his name. Ordered 3 appetizers and 1 main dish (which are recommended by the staff) and all of them are so-so to below average. I'm expecting more since its Gordon restaurant.
3
We reserved this place for 6pax a couple week in advance as they told us the weekends are all fully booked till oct. We ordered 70% of the menu, we got 5 starters, 6 mains , 2 desserts and 1 bottle of wine. Spent about $80 each. Good thing about it is that we get to try most of food for $80. Service is not bad, but don't think I come back again. It's ok
5
The atmosphere of this restaurant is quite relaxed and the staff here are very attentive and friendly. The food is quite delicious, I recommend one of the staff member William's suggestions, go for the Slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly with spiced apple purÃ©e with an additional side of mashed potatoes. Mix in the gravy provided with the pork belly dish with the mashed potatoes and it will make the mashed potatoes taste even better. The BSK short rib beef burger portion is quite substantial and well-cooked, although the spicy mayonnaise which tastes similar to wasabi mayo may put off some other diners. For desserts, the Monkey Shoulder Cranachan cheesecake is suitable for those who like savoury desserts while those with a sweet tooth will love the Banana sticky toffee pudding. The prices on the menu can be expensive, but the food and desserts are highly recommended for a once-in-a-while meal

~YES it's possible! EVEN on that Friday Jul17 on a Hari Raya public holiday! AT 1130hrs when it opened and it was already fully booked!~We'd just parked at MBS Central and walked all the way towards South entrance to Bread Street Kitchen, they had a bistro with indoor seats and another one below. We'd asked and it was both fully booked. The bistro one was positioned facing the bay near where Carnivore is and we really wanted to have our lunch there (without a booking ala Singaporean style like dat one)~First they'd ask if you have a reservation, then they will let you know the table situation. There were none, but we'd noticed 3 tables for 4 outside without any placemats or table setting, and it was exactly 1130am on a HOT & Humid Friday. BSK prolly won't want to seat you outside on a sunny day BUT we be Singaporean lor.I'd asked if we can sit outside and surprise/surprisex2 YEAH the manager said yes if we didn't mind the heat, yes we did not mind!~where the tables were placed, only 1 of them could been seen from the restaurant & there were 2 all weather speakers blaring British oldies, it was loud but bearable and we took the table nearest to MBS glass doors where the sun had not yet shone, the breeze made it ok and it wasn't as humid that day, during the meal we adjusted twice to avoid direct sunlight but it was minimal :)~The wine menu is well curated and my wife liked the Pinot Grigio white by the glass~The odd thing was we were not served any butter/bread but we didn't mind outside~Our server is a very well mannered young Czech man who'd been working aboard cruise ships all over the world and fell in love with Singapore just a month ago... ok we didn't expect much service outside the restaurant as the table we sat at could not been seen at all from within, BUT he appeared almost at every instance we needed something ... OFTEN ... and when we left inside was almost fully packed :) Kudos~We started with a Tagiolini lobster pasta that was homemade in-house, super al dente and perfectly seasoned, my wife said she'd go back to BSK just for that dish & I'd order it when I go back too YUMz~The Mains all arrived at the same time, as we expected from BSK :) OMG the steamed Red Snapper exactly what my wife wanted, the aged Angus Rib-eye a perfect Medium Rare and my son loved this cut, my youngest took the gooey yummy mac & cheese side dish and I'd my lovely Black Cod perfectly baked. All Round Goodness! Do take a look at the photos we took!~Note that there were not much carbs on all the mains, so you may have to order sides to go with them if you wanted... it was just nice without so...:)~The super expensive Fuji water is served if you wanted still, and I do not know if they serve free water..~It was definitely fine dining priced so be prepared to pay, but I'd definitely recommend BSK THUMBS U

The food ranged from OK to good. I thought the Taglioni starter was great. Unfortunately the service experience was mediocre and I would expect more at the prices and with the reputation. The welcome was non-existent and we were left loitering at the entrance eventually forcing the issue that we would like to be seated and get some service. The starters took an age to arrive and the service disappeared during the meal. When we got some attention it was good and very pleasant. The ambience was good although we were tucked away with all the baby seats downstairs.

For our weekly Friday date night, hubby and I tried the newly opened BSK. Booked a table 3 weeks in advance and received a confirmation email but when we arrived, they didn't have our reservation! I put it down to IT system hiccup and we were given a table.Ordered the kale salad, scallops, pork chops and fish and chips, 2 glasses of wine and sparkling water.The food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special. I've had better fish and chips at Pollen. My fish was mushy and the batter soft, under seasoned and lacked flavour. The kale salad was fine but it tasted like the salad I make at home. Hubby's scallop was juicy and flavourful but his pork chop was average. It was also under seasoned.The bread bag was tasty but the butter was not cold.We were given a complimentary dessert platter. The sticky date pudding was delicious. Sweet, moist and flavourful. The pineapple carpaccio was forgettable and the cheese cake tasted like it had too much cream. I didn't like the taste or texture.Overall the food was ok but at the prices they charge I expected more from the kitchen and the service staff. I really wanted BSK to be a restaurant I could visit regularly. Sadly, I don't think I will return, even with the complimentary desserts
2
the seared scallop for starters was a hefty Sgd24 and nothing special with pumpkin puree and slices of apples. I could do better with a pack of scallops from cold storage. The Fish and chips main Sgd 28 was half the usual serving of fish, fried real nicely but was a little saltier than normal, accompanies with peas puree which was nice. Mac and cheese side sgd 10 is recommended. risotto Sgd 28 tasted like canned campbell poured over cooked rice, nothing special. Wasted Sgd 115 on something like home cooked food
2
On arrival we were asked if we wanted sparkling or sill water. We requested still water thinking we would receive tap water. A bottle of water was delivered to the table with no disclosure to the unwary traveller that it was a bottle of branded water. When we went to pay the bill we were shocked to see that we had been charged SGD 10.59 for a bottle of “TAU” spring water. According to TAU Spring Water 2015, TAU Spring Water is specifically designed for designer hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes and features minimalist styling, clear glass and monochromatic labelling to create a design that is quietly understated. No wonder we were so easily duped!The two of us both ordered “Traditional fish & chips, crushed peas, tartare sauce” @ SGD 30.60 each. When questioned about the type of fish, the waitress advised me that the fish was Hoki. This typically very inexpensive New Zealand species is in my opinion and past experience a very unimpressive culinary choice of fish. Also I thought it hardly traditionally English as is the theme of the restaurant. Thinking that Gordon Ramsay may well know more about gastronomy than myself and happy to be proved wrong, I proceeded with the order.Regrettably I was not wrong. The fish fillet was wafer thin greasy and mushy, as I had expected from past experience. The surrounding batter was thick and very oily. In all the so called “traditional fish” was unpleasant and our post purchase dissonance compounded by the price and assumed expectations of quality from an establishment bearing Gordon Ramsay’s name.On the positive: We were provided with complimentary breads and butter; the draft beer was icy cold and served in a metal tankard (for a mere SGD 22.36); and the view across Marina Bay was spectacular

Came here for the first time. Didn't have a reservation (which is recommended, especially on weekends), but the friendly staff managed to get us a table nevertheless. The interior of the restaurant is quite nice and cosy. Service was very friendly, attentive and quick (thanks to Joyce here). The place is very kids friendly (we came with a baby and so did many other people that day). After being recommended some dishes we went for the salmon ceviche, the BSK short rib beef burger and the black angus sirloin steak and we didn't have to wait very long for the food (restaurant was only half full though). Food presentation was nice and everything was cooked just the right way. The ceviche was good and the mango gave it a somewhat exotic taste. I liked the sauce on the burger, which was a bit spicy and gave it a bit of a different taste than just another regular burger. Prices are a bit on the higher side, but I guess you pay for the name as well. Would probably come back here although not top of my list

Visited this place with one of My friend during the early opening dinner,Loved the hospitality of The staff,they all kept smiling & our Server Kathy was just very helpful & with perfect in recommending food & drinks as well.As i am a vegetarian & fine with egg, they dint had much varieties to try but I opted as per Kathy's suggestions I had Irish Couscous salad,grilled Asparagus with poached egg.The desserts were the best to try.The coffee parfait & monkey shoulder were too good.My friend had Salmon capriccio & grilled duck.We both enjoyed our food & Drink. Overall a nice place with lively music & beautiful view with open bar.Worth a visit .

BSK enjoys a beautiful location, perfect for dining outdoors. Service was very average in the bar area, perhaps better in restaurant? ...we started the evening asking for everything .....can we order, can we have bread, can we have cutlery, can we have napkins .......Disappointing in what is not a large restaurant. Our complaint was met with sneers rather than an apology. Food was good. Fish wonderfully delicate, maki rolls lovely. Decent wine list
4
Decided to entertain business colleagues to lunch here, not realising it was a recently opened establishment, and being lunch, did not bother to book ahead. On arrival, was informed that they were fully booked for the next month! However, we could eat at one of their long bar tables, (rather than at a proper dining table), which we did. Staff were friendly and efficient, and food well prepared. However, my burger arrived rare rather than medium-well as requested. On drawing this to the waiter's attention, it was quickly replaced, so full marks there. By current Singapore restaurant prices, the cost was reasonable for one of this standard. Overall, I would rate this restaurant as up to the standard expected

Having dined at BSK in Hong Kong and been thoroughly impressed with the meal and service there, I was happy to see BSK Singapore open up in June. The opening festivities were complete with an appearance by Chef Ramsay and all the fanfare you would expect from the newest restaurant from a Michelin starred chef to hit the shores of Singapore and Marina Bay Sands.BSK is what I would classify as upscale comfort food and British favorites; it's nothing overly fancy or pretentious -nor should it be- and the setting is homey and comfortable with the added bonus of a gorgeous view of the Central Business District of Singapore. The advantage that BSK has compared to all the other 'celebrity chef' restaurants in the Marina Bay Sands complex is that it is located along the marina bay esplanade, with outdoor open air bar seating on nice evenings. It's also close to Marina Bay Financial Center which makes the restaurant an easy walk for anyone looking for a quality lunch. I was fortunate enough to be able to dine here twice in a 36 hour period: once during the lunch hour with chef Ramsay and his management team in the house, and the next night for dinner. The food was top notch for both meals. Lunch consisted of the burger and a salad and a refreshing non-alcoholic mocktail. I was seated at the bar and the service was top notch. Chef Ramsay even popped up to the bar area at one point to talk with someone from his management team who was seated near me (sadly I didn't get a chance to say hi or snap a selfie with him!). The next night, my girlfriend and I dined here for dinner at the quasi outdoor bar seating area (tables in the dining room were booked solid!). The food was equally as good but the service wasn't as good as the previous day. Soup was delivered without a soup spoon, empty plates went uncleared for a long period of time, and it took quite a while to get the bill. But I would chalk this up to the fact the restaurant just opened and they are still sorting out some of the service issues. I wouldn't let this deter you from giving this place a try though as the service levels are still way above average. The thing that is really awesome here are the desserts. We had the Treacle Tart and the Banana Sticky Toffee Pudding - both were rich, decadent and full of flavor and they are some of the best desserts I've had in Singapore. I wasn't surprised by this considering the dessert I had at BSK Hong Kong ranks in my all time top 10. I look forward to many more meals at BSK Singapore and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some ridiculously good comfort food

I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan so maybe I am a little biased. I really enjoyed the visit. I had a caesar salad to start and then the shepperd's pie. Both were outstanding. I was surprised that it wasn't very full. I struggled to get a reservation and finally did. Then I was in the area an hour early and was able to get a table early with no problems. I will come again

With Gordon Ramsey's new Restaurant Bread Street Kitchen opening in Singapore as a real fan of the chef I was really looking forward to going to eat at his restaurant. Excitement very quickly turned to disappointment... I ordered a Gin & Tonic and waited 15 minutes to arrive at the table. Not the greatest of starts but I thought it would get better. The party was 8, 4 adults 4 children, bread was brought to the children's table but not to the adults, we had to ask for bread to be brought to our table which eventually came. Typically when out with the children we like to order there food first so they can eat. We ordered the chicken wings, plain for the kids, they arrived over cooked, dry and quite frankly looked as if they were frozen bought as i've had similar from the local supermarket. My daughter asked for fish & chips, these are served with crushed peas, my wife let the waiter know on at least 2 occasions that we did not want the crushed peas with my daughters dinner and yes you guessed it the crushed peas arrived on my dauhters dinner. Not a train smash I know but as with anyone who has kids who see something on their plate that they dont want its then very difficult to turn the meal around.I ordered a Rib Eye steak at $68 a very nice steak but that was it. The steak was not seasoned at all and I called for extra seasoning. Both the salt mills I had were pretty empty and I got nothing out of them. I then paid $12 for chips, What I got was a small tub of frozen unseasoned chips. If you are charging 412 for these at least have the professional pride to make fresh chips. I'm not sure whether Gordon will read this but can I suggest that instead of critisizing a whole host of other restaurants I suggest you take a serious look at your own. You say that critical feed back is important to you, I hope you take this on board. The whole experience was completely underwhelming and we all left extremely disappointed. I didn't complain I simply paid the bill which for 4 adults and 4 kids was not far off $800. Ive eaten at Maize in London on several occasions and know what your food can be like so this simply falls well short of anything I would have expected from a restaurant that bears your name

The food was excellent. I ordered pork belly and it was cooked just right. The skin was a more on the crunchy side than crispy but other that that it was alright. Dessert was good. Ordered tart with Creme fraiche ice cream and it was real good. Staff were friendly. Three is a backlog of reservations at the moment

What an amazing place fantastic food fantastic service and Sabrina the executive chef is so lovely and so talented can't wait to go back

Having tried Bread Street Kitchen and Heddon Street Kitchen in London a couple of times (last december and last month), I wanted to find out how BSK Singapore match up to them. So I went with my sons and hubby BSK Singapore for lunch today. Some of the food we ordered were the same (burger and chocolate fondant) as what we had in London, others were new (roast duck, sea trout, shepherds pie). Overall, the food tasted good, especially the shepherds pie and the sea trout. The burger was as good as the one we had in London. However, i didn't like the roast duck. While it was nicely done medium, it had a strong gamey taste. For the chocolate fondant, while it had a rich chocolate taste, it still has room for improvement to reach the standard in London, which was a very thin chocolate crust and a thick but still very gooey centre. The crust here was almost a thick layer of cake and the middle was too liquidy. For homely British food, it is somewhat expensive

 I think the concept of bringing UK pub food into a nice dining environment is a great addition to MBS food scene but the quality of dishes was average. Bit disappointing cause I expected Gordon Ramsay to really maintain his standards amongst some of the other chef's restaurants in MBS. Pork belly was really good though, I must say. Fish and chips was bit greasy, tuna tartare tasting too much like kimchi, Alaskan king crab starter could use a little bit more acidity. Early days and maybe let them settle in a little bit more

Singapore needs more restaurants with this sort of concept. Comfort food, a casual environment and decent prices. Happened to walk-in after a cancellation, service was a little lacking on the knowledge of what they were serving. Quality of product wasn't to the standard you would expect in one of GRs restaurants in London. Rubbery frozen scallops and not so fresh Cod fish. Though saying that it is early days, and I am a fan of his casual dining establishments in London. Hope they can get over the teething problems. Shall revisit when I'm next in town

Once again a famous restaurant that forgets to try. Is the same sad story of Jamie Oliver resto in Singapore. Brought my team of 6 to give this new restaurant a shot! Called and told them I've 2 colleagues having birthday on the same date, so we're heading there for a celebration lunch! The day arrives and I received a phone call from a lady whom I've no idea what she was mumbling about. I said "excuse me?" then I heard something of a kitchen? I thought what a terrible way to get a staff who can't speak properly to call their customers. I always believe that when you get poor service right at the front desk reception of a resto, your dining experience is going to be a disaster. Indeed, the starter bread they brought out was of average quality. It reminds me of the bread I have from SQ. SQ probably better as bread was warm. Some of us have cocktails, each at SGD 25 and the glass they use is pathetic. Such small glass I wish I've taken all of them to CUT where each cocktail is at SGD 26 with big round glass and they all taste extraordinary. I'd 2 glass of Pinot Grigio at SGD 20 each. Certainly not 175ml as they advertise (more like 110ml). Chianti was average at SGD 26 each. We'd 5 different appetizers, only the spicy Tuna tartare stands out. Pls don't have their Maki Roll (SGD 18), tiny 6 small pieces which Itacho sushi taste much better. 4 tiny piece of Asparagus top with a warm egg (SGD 20) is of poor value. Main course some of us had 24oz of their 300day steak (SGD 180) and half of it was fats. The grilled half lobster as the main course (SGD 25) was so tiny, I ate it in 2 bites! We ordered sides of Macaroni Cheese and honeyed Carrots. Macaroni cheese is ok - Bedrock wins them hands down. I thought the honeyed carrots taste like petrol but 1 of my colleague likes it. Dessert is another disappointing affair. We ordered 4 different types. All of them are very very ordinary and really, PS Cafe has very similar food. It is half the price that of Bread Street and the quality is way better in PS Cafe.By the way, they didn't remember/offer to wish my 2 colleagues Happy Birthday. Can't be back again

This is the third Gordon Ramsay‬ restaurant we've been to, after The London, Los Angeles and Verre, Dubai (incidentally both have closed down!). The salmon ceviche and scallop appetizers, roasted pork belly and beef short ribs burger were all OK without being fantastic.Our dining experience did not go off to a good start as the kitchen committed one of my greatest dining pet peeves.... sending out the mains before the apps (!!!), so I told them to take it back and to serve a fresh set again after our apps. Our mains were duly served in the right order but I then had to send my medium burger back because the center was raw. At this point I was suppressing my inner Ramsay to yell at the Hublot-wearing Hostess, "‪‎It's Raw‬, you ‎Donkey‬ !!!" but quickly realised that this was not Hell's Kitchen and gazed out at the great Marina Bay view instead.To their credit the Maitre D' came around to apologise and the service recovery was excellent. Would I go back? Maybe not...

We managed to get a cancellation booking as walk-ins but don't count on that - we were very lucky...at the moment, booking is a must.The greetings lady really struggled with quite a basic English conversation so it took us a while to figure out whether or not we had a snowballs chance in hell but soon figured it out when she called my mobile 20mins after we registered for cancellation bookings. I wouldn't normally moan about a restaurant in a foreign country not speaking English but this is Singapore we are talking about and a British restaurant to boot...The restaurant itself is in a great location and the decor is lovely although we did feel like we were actually on the date that was happening next to us at one point....the chap was a very loud talking American though so we could have been sat on opposite side of the restaurant and still been included on the date.The menu was fabulous and couldn't fault the eagerness of the waiter. That being said, the rather expensive bottle of wine we ordered didn't arrive until after our starters so we weren't very happy (having deliberated as to whether or not to buy a full bottle but rationalising we would be able to finish it throughout the meal only for it to not arrive until a third of the way through) that being said, we are British so still managed to finish it by time the restaurant closed! The scallop starter was absolutely delicious as was the risotto main. My husband assures me the burger was also lovely and cooked to perfection. The fondant dessert was also absolutely amazing although mint ice cream accompanying is a bit random and would have fathered vanilla but each to their own. Overall it was a lovely meal and would definitely go back should we find ourselves in Singapore again. May have to go to the London one and see how that fares

We luckily were able to get a table for 4 at lunch time a few days after Bread Street had opened. Have to say the meal was well below average for 2 of our meals. We had the burger and a half cup of juice was left on the plate after trying to eat it, not nice. Shepherds pie was ok, but lots of oil left in the bottom of dish. Fish and chips were fine, along with the vegetarian cous cous dish, again though average flavours. The service was very good, even though the staff had to walk down the restaurant holding the trays of food above their shoulders to make their way to the diners, which is going to end in disaster some day for someone!! Gordon you need to review your own restaurant, we would be surprised if it comes anywhere near your expectations

Wow, must be an awesome restaurant if is fully booked for the next 4 weeks! Isn't it?Or is it maybe just the massive marketing engine that drives the masses' attraction to GR's restaurants? Who knows, let's talk about the facts:Pros:+ Upstairs you can get great sunset views of the Singapore skyline. Great for visitors.+ Nice decor, friendly staff (except for the 'receptionist')+ Great, standard food. Good quality and taste+ Nice presentationCons:- Nothing special. Feels like the menu was created to guarantee the success of the restaurant. Anything that sells. Carpaccio, vitello tonato, ceviche, sashimi, fish & chips, burger, cod fish, steak. Oh, so you didn't know this was modern British food?- Waited 20 min for the bottle of wine to come out but I think it shall be forgiven -'teething issues'. Just make sure that part doesn't get featured in Hell's Kitchen.- They should tell people that you can actually just walk in. Several empty table

We phoned to try and book a table for two, Saturday afternoon. We were told we could not book but if we arrived about 4pm we should be fine to walk in!Sadly not the case when we arrived, we explained we had called earlier, the waitress huffed, snatched up two menus and said follow me!!We felt like We had just done something wrong. She led us to a table looking out to the bay. Put the menus down and said to let you know I need the table clear by 6pm! and walked away!!!! Really wanted to leave at that point, but glad we didn't!The food was really very good,if a little on the pricey side! Come on Gordon, Shepherds pie $38!!!!!?The beer was served in icy cold tankards, loved that idea. The fish and chips at a reasonable $26 was light and full of flavour. We had to have desert as the banana sticky toffee pudding boasted 'clotted cream' as I come from the home of clotted cream in Devon in the UK it was a must and although there could have been more sauce the cream was just lovely, in that first mouthful I was transported home!!The service I have to say was a little disappointing, my husband had to ask for drinks and have our table cleared(they were not that busy)We felt we should pass our feedback to the manager, after listening to our comments really had nothing to offer, coffee on the house or anything would have suggested our experience was valid!!Think Gordon should have stayed a little longer to have his staff better trained!!

Wow what a experience ..l from turning up to be told they are booked out but then going to check and giving us the option to eat and be out in a hour and half window was a great option we were given from the start ... Many places would just say sorry booked our !! We had kids as well ... William suggested it and took us to our table ! To then get the beautiful food that we did , cooked as well as it was and as quick as it was was magnificent ,,,, THEN to get offered if our kids would like a trip to meet HEAD chef Sabrina and then be asked if they would like to make their own dessert .... What a experience kids and we will remember forever ... Thankyou William, Sabrina and all the staff .... Highly Highly recommend !!! Well done Bread Stree

When I first heard that BSK was open for reservations, I immediately called in to make a booking for dinner. The staff who answered the call was patient and polite, very smooth booking process! On the big night itself, we arrived at BSK and was greeted by an unsure waitress at the front desk. I told her I made a reservation but she kept assuming I'm a walk-in customer without reservation and insisted that the restaurant was fully booked for the night. However, things were cleared after I repeated myself. Upon seated down, the general manager came to our table. To my surprise, he questioned me again if I made a reservation and reiterated that the restaurant is fully booked and our seats are already taken. I had to explain myself again and tell him which waitress sat me at my table. Not a very pleasant way to start off the night. Bad things aside, we tried the Tamarind spiced chicken wings, the pork belly, BSK beef burger, Banana sticky toffee pudding and some coffee to end off. Food was great for the price paid, especially the chicken wings! We spent about $130 for 2 pax. In conclusion, It's still early days at BSK and I hope they sort out their management issues promptly. A bit of disappointment at the start, however, the service, ambience, food were fantastic. Will be coming back soon to try out other dishes

Well. What can I say! It was a good meal and not as expensive as many will think. Abt $100 per person with wine. And the quality of food is good and wine is good. Am glad that it's works out great and it's now in Singapore! Hooray!

Nice environment. Food was OK but not great: mocktails were average, shepherd's pie was good and dessert too. But what about the service??? Mocktails came after the main course, one of the dessert was not available. My chocolate fondant came very late.... They forgot it....Gordon Ramsey should come back to coach his team (he is supposed to be an Expert coach) and train them to take care of the clients!

Bread Street Kitchen finally opened.Yes, it is the Casual Dining of the Famous Gordon Ramsey.And, yes, he opened in Singapore, precisely at Marina Bay Sands with other Celebrity Chef such as Daniel Boulud, Justin Quek, Wolfgang Puck, Tetsuya from Waku Ghin, Mario Batali…. (Sorry for Guy Savoy which had to close his fine dining) and more.For those who don’t know who’s Gordon Ramsey, well he’s a worldwide known (Michelin Star awarded) British Chef for a multitude of restaurants and TV shows such as Hell’s Kitchen, MasterChef USA, Kitchen Nightmares.. and more….!So, when someone like him open a new venture, expectations are high.At least for me.I never had a chance (yet) to dine in one of his fine dining, at least his 3 Michelin Stars in London, so I have to content myself with his Casual Dining.Of course, watching most of his shows, knowing where he’s coming from (trained in France), with a lots of successful restaurants, I still have some expectation from his team, even if it’s a casual dining!Come on, if tomorrow you buy the cheapest Ferrari ever, you still expect to be a Ferrari; the name is here; well same in this case…So, pardon Chef, but let’s do a “Hell’s Kitchen” Review….Located in the shopping area of Marina Bay Sands, the main dining area is at the ground floor with a small outdoor and the kitchen with private dining will be at the basement 1.The decor is casual with a bit of elegance as well but nothing exceptional. For the negative point, if you eat at the bay windows, you will get the sun in your face, no blinds or nothing to protect and this is annoying. I mean that it is not great to eat with the sun in your face… Detail which hopefully will be fixed.read more here:https://drinkeattrip.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/bread-street-kitchen

When we lived in London BSK opened nearby and a place we enjoyed visiting. Now we're in Singapore BSK has now also opened 10 mins walk away. We've had the pleasure of eating at BSK twice in it's first week of opening and to me it's better than London. We first visited on day two of opening and you could tell they were finding their feet. We then visited on their second busy Friday and BSK was well into it's swing with good service to a demanding clientele,Whilst BSK London is big and "echo-ey" Singapore is more intimate. In London some of the waiting staff can be "snooty French" whilst here they are friendly and keen to help.The menu is modern British with a few Asian alternatives. We loved the beef brisket and asparagus starters. The shepherds pie shows you can make great British food if you have some panache and the right ingredients and the chocolate fondant was truley delightful. The Monkey Shoulder (whisky) Chranachan is a modern take on a Scottish dessert, nice but a bit short on the whisky flavour. Having extensively tasted the menu, nothing disappoints.The wine list is extensive though the wines by the glass, which we prefer, is a bit limited. The white wines in particular try to be unusual. Why do so many restaurants want to have Austrian and German wine when some good new world chardonnay's and Italian pinot grigio's etc deliver better?That apart, we hope the menu changes every so often so we can keep coming back. BSK is going to become a favourite

Brought my mum, sis and fiancé to my favorite celebrity chef first restaurant in Singapore. Between us, we tasted 10 dishes and 2 non-alcoholic cocktails. Total cost came up to SGD375. We had the seared scallops, Alaskan King Crab and Tagliolini lobster for starters. We simply loved the scallops which was very well done and seasoned. My sis loves the crab best.For main dishes, because of my mum's dental condition, I ordered more softer food, the steamed red snapper, roasted duck breast and roasted sea trout. For myself and my sister we cannot resist ordering the Dingley pork belly. I must say we love all the dishes except the pork belly. The red snapper I will order again and again, simply loved the freshness of the fish, the razor clams and the super delicious braised leeks. The mulled berries sauce complement the duck perfectly. The pork belly on the other hand was a disappointment. The skin was too hard and not crispy enough. The meat is bland by Singaporean standards. For locals who grew up having Asian styled roasted pork belly as part of our cuisine, I am sorry but have to say that the Dingley pork belly is nowhere near the Asian standard. For desserts, we had the monkey shoulder cranachan cheesecake, banana sticky toffee pudding and the pineapple capaccio with coconut sorbet. The cheesecake is delicious and the pineapple capaccio is simply refreshing and a splendid finale for the meal. We ordered two cocktails, the forbidden forest and rhythm and blues. Both are average and forgettable. The rhythm and blues is definitely not value for money as I can finish it in one gulp. The service was good, the bread and butter served before meal was delicious. I have made another reservation in two weeks' time to try the fish and chips. Overall, we did enjoy the good food. I am no gourmet but have eaten widely, some of the dishes are simply delicious. Will definitely visit again

As big Gordon Ramsay fans we visited the first Sunday after opening fully aware that this was not fine dining. I will not bore you with the details of our reservation, how BSK messed it up or how they then called on my mobile to confirm my allegedly non-existent booking, 10 minutes after we had ordered!! OK maybe a teething problem 2 days after opening. No problem there as long as it improves. As to the food itself, it really is nothing special with no wow factor. Nothing you can not get elsewhere. Don't get me wrong. It is perfectly fine but there is nothing to set it apart from a hundred other places. We had the crab apple salad, chicken wings and lobster pasta starters then the veal shin, trout and pork belly as mains. Perfectly fine but nothing special or imaginative. Also unlike other BSK's around the world there was no Sunday roast. Maybe this will be rectified going forward and if they do that well, they will at least set themselves apart from the rest of the crowd as very few in Singapore do this and none that I have found do it well. The final "surprise" came on asking for the bill. I do not exaggerate when I say it arrived in less than 10 seconds!! I even commented to the waiter that it must have been one they prepared earlier but the irony was lost on him. Overall verdict is that we would not go out of our way to go back but if we were passing and DB Bistro was full, then we may pop in for a quick stomach filler

Food was excellent. The complimentary basket(s) of bread was good. The hot starters of tamarind spiced chicken wings was juicy. Regarding the fish and chips, the fish was moist, the chips stayed crispy even after half an hour - most will get soft and soggy. I could empathize with the staff, having the reservation lines ringing nonstop from opening till 6pm, receiving hundreds of reservation emails in each day. With the high traffic of guest, couldn't blame anyone for imperfect service. A special shout out to Manu, the Restaurant Manager. He was especially friendly, introducing us the place, the concept, the people etc. even though we can tell he was really busy. We will be back again in the future for special occasions

Well, there are many eateries around the bay area, but not so many good ones. This place just opened so the level of service is not there yet. It seems like there are many management staff and opening support team, but they all don't know how to smile. When I went, there was MBS CEO brining an old Chinese man in, the Caucasian hostess literary pushed my friend away from the entrance without saying an excuse. She is caucasian so I assume she can speak english.. but obviously forgot the manners and smile. Quality of food is fine. price is reasonable.Will I come back? Probably I will give a try again
