Hokkien prawn mee no longer nice. The other dishes are average. Crabs used to be okay, but now it is below-average.

Get on board with black pepper grab. Expensive like anything in Singapore but great meal especially with dumplings.

Every time I go to Singapore, I always go to this place for lunch or dinner. Though it is not within the city proper, it is worth the short trip going to Kim's Place.I love their black pepper crab, crispy cereal prawns, seafood rice and their own version of singapore chili crab. You dont have to buy big crabs since even the small ones taste so good. Make sure to go here w/ empty stomach because you will definetely grab a lot of food here!

Visited Kim's place a few weeks ago with a couple friends. We were absolutely blown away. We started out with a couple appetizers: the fried mini soft shell crabs with chili and garlic and the salted egg yolk coated fried salmon skins. Both appetizers were hot, crispy, and loaded with flavor. The soft shell crab had just the right amount of heat, we scarfed them down just like a big bowl of popcorn. The salmon skin was really interesting, it was unlike anything I've ever had before. it was salty and had a really deep, complex, savory fish flavor. Next up was the crab fried rice which was one of the best bowls of fried rice I've ever had. For entrees we had the soy braised pork knuckle and the sea cucumber in abalone sauce, both of which were fantastic. All the food we had was awesome, the owner was very friendly, he came out and explained all of the dishes to us, it was an awesome experience. I would definitely recommend Kim's place to anyone coming to Singapore

This is probably my 3rd visit to Kim's Place at Joo Chiat, the restaurant I'll go to when I have a craving for fried Hokkien Mee.Personally, I would much prefer the Hokkien Mee to be fried in a "not too wet" style. While Kim's treatment is not exactly my preference it is becoming very challenging to find the Chef or Hawker who could deliver this Singaporean dish in the taste that I like.During our recent visit we ordered, besides the Hokkien mee, a cereal prawn and broccoli cooked in shrimp paste. The prawns were tasty - the meat is tender and flavourful. The broccoli was crunchy and the shrimp paste made it even more appetising.Overall it was a satisfying meal

Kim’s Place Seafood located in Joo Chiat Lane This place has everything for a local dining experience. It’s out of the city centre but it’s worth the drive. So, we decided to visit on a week night to beat the weekend crowd. The food is great. Its signature dish is the fried hokkien noodles, and off course seafood, In fact, the dishes that we ordered were delicious. Price is mid-range...a lot cheaper than the crabs we had at the Jumbo Restaurant in Clarke Quay. It’s worth it...be rest assure. Although the restaurant's location was out of the way, it didn't stopped regulars from making their way there. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

Fist time in Singapore where everybody was telling me about chili crab... so I tried some until I got to Kim's place. It was an amazing experience! Tried the chili and the pepper crab, just delicious, couldn't stop myself to even taste the sauce with bums.If you get lucky you could even meet Kim, the owner, such a sympathetic lad!I really recommend you this place!!

Had a late night meal here with a close friend - she was the one who stopped and looked at this place while we were trying to choose restaurants along Joo Chiat. Am I glad that she chose this place.It was just us and another big group so we had the restaurant almost all to ourselves. We had the oyster omelet - which will make you forget all the other oyster omelets you've ever tasted in your entire life. My friend and I agreed that it was the absolute best we've ever tasted. We also had hokkien mee - just as superb. The bamboo clams were pretty standard - Jumbo Seafood's version of the bamboo clams is better. But that oyster omelet alone made the visit worth it. I am definitely going back to this place just to have that again

Walked past and was attracted by the restaurant's advertisement and displays on their Hokkien mee. Went in and ordered Hokkien Mee and several dishes for a family of 5. We are not a seafood fan so did not try their crabs. Food was average, Tou fu with mince meat and broccoli was good, Hokkien Mee was above average, fragrant pork below average. Guess they shd be famous with their crabs as I saw many tables ordered. The bill ends up $108.00 without seafood

We had 2 medium sized crabs (about 0.8kg each) in 2 different styles - steamed as well as ginger & spring onion. The crabs were fresh and meaty. The total bill came up to $131.80 for the 2 crabs only (we did not order any other dishes) which we found to be on the pricey side.

I love the seafood fried rice. Very well done and tasty. Their specialty is the hokkien noodles. They sell seafood and their prices are pretty reasonable.

Though basic in furnishing, the service level, attention given and the quality of seafood and the taste more than compensate. There is Private room for family celebration with privacy. Will be back again!

The restaurant is very nice, their sepciality is the crab. They cooked it in different way, we took the black pepper crab it was delicious

A Singaporian friend took us for dinner - group of 10. Had chili crab, pepper crab, fish skin and more and all was just great. Need to order a place and a short drive from the city but it worth it. With my extended experiance - i recommend

The two of us went on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was empty except for 2 other tables. We ordered the signature Hokkien noodles (average like those served at hawker centre except the prawns are the large version), potato leaves fried with garlic, and prawn rolls with water chestnut (with honey as dip). With two glasses of juice (barley and lime juice), the bill came up to S$32.00. There is nothing special about the three items, which I rate as 'average.

Black pepper crab, cereal prawn , broccoli w mushroom and egg oyster omelet was good . We particularly like the black pepper crab- we ordered a big one about 1.5 kg,Disappointed by the Hokkien Noodle bcos it had no 'wok hei' considering it was their signature !

Usually packed on the weekends. So, we decided to visit on a week night. It's signature dish is the fried hokkien noodles. You can have the traditional non spicy, or another version, spicy n add on the extras with oysters. We ordered both that night. It was really really nice ... Guess, they fried with pork lard making it even tastier. Prawns n oysters were fresh.The baked pepper crab over 1.7kg was also very good. The steamed bamboo clams were delicious. In fact, the dishes we had that night was pretty good. One restaurant that I would return any day n frequent enough to wet my appetite

We went on a Groupon and they tried to con us with the size of the crabs we ordered.The size was suppose to be huge (sic) of at least 1kg. Instead it was barely 600gms and the over-cooked. Had to argue to get a reduction on the bill.

We were taken to this restaurant by my niece for a big family dinner. We had quite a few dishes such as crab with black pepper, mixed vegetables in belachan sauce, mee goreng, fried noodles, oyster omelette, prawn dish and a few others that I can't remember. The oyster omelette I would never bother again. The crabs were well overpriced. The only dishes worth mentioning were the mee goreng and the mixed vegetables. Would I go there again.........probably not.
