The ideal of using organically sourced meat and vegetables is really appealing and the presentation of the food well-thought of. My pork ribs were well-cooked but it would have been much better with a liitle more BBQ sauce. The restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere and the shop stocks a wide selection of products for those who wish to purchase organic, herbal or grow-your-own products.

This occupies a whole 3rd floor at Kitchener Complex.Very impressive with a restaurant plus cafe and a very huge impressive super market too.They sell a huge variety of food & vegetable produce. Prices reasonable too. Mahota sells organic produces procured from their own farms in China.Conveniently located just beside the Lavender MRT station. For those driving there is a HDB multi- storey car park nearby linked from one building to the next by a link bridge on the 3rd floor. Food there is reasonable as they are using ingredients and produce from tier Mahota Farm from Shangai. Sells a wide collection of wine too.One is able to sign up for a membership if one intends to eat and shop there often.

My Friend chanced upon this restaurant and suggested we gave it a try and it was surprisingly good.It seemed to be in seclusion in Kitchener Complex with an organic supermarket next to it. It slowly got crowded with lunch hours.The menu offers a wide selection of organic dishes and we decided on the element 9 box set and a charcoal crab pizza. The element box comprises of sampling dishes, similar to tapas and majority of these dishes were nicely done and seasoned. Overall we enjoyed the element box which gives us a better feel of what their mains would be like.The crab pizza was the best surprise. We ordered it with some doubts as we had never tried a crab pizza before and we were really happy that it was so tasty.The ambience and food of the restaurant truly is TOP notch. The only thing they may need to look into can be on their staff service. Service was acceptable but it was pretty robotic. There was hardly a smiley face on the floor nor any warmth of welcome. Service was just going through the motion.I will definitely return to the restaurant as it seriously is a great chill out place away from hassle and bustle.

Visited 2 times in Sept. Once was for a fare-well dinner for a friend. We had 2 nine-variety food bento sets and hotpot. For the other one, we had the pandan cake, organic beer and iced mocha. In general, a culinary delight for the senses. There is also an market next door, so shopping and studio for events such as wine-tasting/ classes

Complimentary bread was served with vinegar and olive oil at the start of the meal. Organic bread tasted SO dry and hard, we couldn't even finish it.Ordered 2 mahota hotpot - 1 tomato based soup and 1 pork based soup. Ingredients were the same, vegetables, beancurd, proteins and Konjac noodles. Portion is quite large but not enough for 2 to share I guess. There are steps to follow to cook the food, like vegs first and branches etc, which made the process quite troublesome. A mini vinegar drink was served after the hotpot meal to cleanse the system.Mahota 9 element box 1 - pretty large portion too. All 9 elements have strong and different flavors which confused the taste buds a lot since we do not know where to start eating or which one to start eating first? Most items were chilled.Organic lamb rack - ordered medium and came a little under, lamb was quite chewy. A very fatty lamb too, quite tasty but just hard to chew it down because it wasn't as medium as we wanted it to be. Potatoes served with it was sadly undercooked (who undercook their potatoes lol!) Gnocchi - the smallest in portion, barely enough for 1 pax. Gnocchi was thick large pieces that was a little too chewy as well. Cream cheese sauce is rich and heavy.Charcoal pizza - supposedly their recommended pizza flavor, the Italian sausage was really tough and not juicy. Bacon was crispy and fried well though. Pizza was VERY thin, almost like fried wanton skin (where's all the dough?!), it feels like I'm just eating cheesy tomato with some sausages, bacon, pineapples. Can't really taste the pizza dough. Ice chai latte - asked if it was sweetened and they said the powder is pre-mixed so will be sweet, requested them to put less powder but in the end the drink tasted like sweet milk with some cinnamon powder, no chai taste.Honey lemon - came with dried lemon instead of the usual fresh ones. Drink however had nothing to shout about.Had 3 different chocolate drinks - Ice shaken chocolate, ice chocolate frappe and ice chocolate. All the same kind of chocolate but just that some is served with ice, some served ice blended. Normal tasting chocolates.Overall prices were quite high, we had 5 mains, 1 pizza and 5 drinks. Average per pax is around $40-$50. A little overrated with all the organic stuff but the quality of food isn't of great standard even though the ingredients they used is good

Went there for lunch this week, find this place very nice with plenty of plants around. We had steak, fish and pork all cook to perfection with accompanying organic vegetables, we clean our plates satisfied. There's a organic mart next to the restaurant. Will go there again soon

A friend recommended this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. It was certainly pleasant surprise. If you are looking for healthy and organic, then this might just be the place for you.The ambiance - very good. Staff were attentive. Food was of high quality though some drink choices had run out when we ordered for them. I would suggest you check out the serving size when ordering for some very large, at least in my view. In regards to the cost, I did find the price a little on the up side, but if a celebration is called for, then I guess it will be well worth a visit. Reservations may be a good thing on weekends and peak hours. Parking was a little challenging but ample enough. The carpark was on another side that was adjoining the complex but directions were clear enough. You will need to take the connecting walkway to the actual location of the restaurant. I would say, I enjoyed it all and recommend you try it out

We brought our family to dine at Mahota Kitchen. We had the hotpot and pork knuckle which were excellent. I like the concept of promoting healthy living all under one roof and also how this business evolved from the traditional Prime Supermarket chain to Mahota Commune. The supermarket in the Commune is well-stocked with all types of organic food but prices are unsurprisingly not cheap. Items served at the restaurant and cafe are cooked using ingredients grown on their own farms. These ingredients can also be found in their supermarket. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience for us

I visit this place often to do a bit of work, catch up with friends and as well as had a networking event. Lovely place in general but bookings can go missing sometimes. Wifi is unstable so don't rely on it.The draw is not the food they serve but rather the food they sell in the supermarket. A good concept and you will empty your pockets that is something Organic after every visit.

Great little cafe and eatery. Organic shopping and many specialty items for sure. nice Chai and iced coffee as well.

Mahota Kitchen (in Mahota Commune) is perfect for people who are yearning for organic ingredients. The food tastes fine, flavors are not too intense, and they have a wide array of sauces to choose from. I guess this was the healthiest bacon, pineapple pizza I have ever tried. They also have a 9-element set boxes which come in vegetarian or non-vegetarian versions. These are basically sets of small plates. The commune sells a lot of other products from dinner ware to massage oils and they have their own grocery as well. This place is definitely worth visiting

1 plate of bread, 2 drinks, 2 main course and 1 salad came up to around $87. The salad is awesome that every leaf of veg is so fresh! Pizza is awesome, the ingredients taste so fresh and not those commercialized pizza u get! However, the duck is a tad small. We applaud the chef for creating very unique food flavor. And, it is all worth it. Service is great too.

A feast for all the senses! Sustainably sourced ingredients are delicately crafted into whimsical and flavorful dishes at the restaurant in Mahota Commune. The service is also to notch and impeccable. Tip: Call ahead to make reservations especially if your party is big.I enjoyed a Heidinger pale ale poured into super chilled Steins. Then they served bread at room temperature with nutty olive oil and balsamic. At the table, there is cracked pepper and salt to dress the dip. Furthermore, there is a sauce station where you can dip your bread or accompany your meal with delicious bursts of flavor: Black sesame, pesto, ginger, tomato, konbu, And a secret Spicy Mahota blend. At the station, they also have thinly sliced chilies, minced garlic, green onion and cilantro.I chose the 9 Element Set with meat. There is also a 9 Element Set that is vegetarian.This tasting set arrived in a lovely wooden box with a lid. The server revealed my meal with flair. It was overwhelmingly beautiful. I ate across the rows from top to bottom, left to right. I enjoyed the cold kebab of handcrafted sausage, cantaloupe ball and grape tomato with a tangy citrus sauce. Cold cut thinly sliced roast beef with carrot filigree and caviar-like goodness. I accompanied that course with the ginger and black sesame sauces. I also enjoyed the Konbu salad and the smoke salmon. My parents shared the hot pot. Wow! The broth was super tasty after all the raw ingredients were added and enjoyed. Our table also ordered the mushroom soup that was smooth and creamy. The humongous pork knuckle was tasty and texturrific! The crackling was fabulous. Try the meat with the different sauce offering!The wait staff was always there clearing plates and making sure that there was plenty of water and other libations desired. Mahota is a great place to eat and feel good about sending love to Mother Earth

This place is a space incorporated with a market place, restaurant and some lessons such as yoga and meditation.If I am into wrong, this place sells organic items around the regions, such as Japan, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Malaysia.They have a western and eastern restaurants and also sell the bread they made themselves.We ordered some food, which is not bad actually though I have to say price is on the steep side.The Pandan coconut cake is very raw, whcih retains the original flavours.A good place to explore

Mahota is located on the highest floor of the Kitchener complex. Besides a mart that sells and promotes all things organic, there is also a cafe and a restarurant. My friend and I headed to the cafe, and here you can have various dishes, meats, rice, freshly blended juices, ice cream and also cakes.It's light decor creates a pleasing ambience for great conversations. You can also browse through and purchase organic foodstuff imported from prime supliers- bags, cutlery, honey, rice, juices, sugar and tea. There is also a playroom and an art room to cater for the young children

It is a short walk from Lavender MRT. Parking is available on-site on French Road in an adjacent building connected by a bridge.Set lunch on weekdays is very good value for $21 with bread, salad or soup, selection of main and a small dessert.I returned on a Saturday. There is no set menu. Serving sizes are bigger. Beware the cakes, very big servings for the price.Decent food presentation. The salted caramel chocolate fudge cake was average.

It was a wonderful dining experience for our family outing..we ordered 2 hotpots and a large pizza..we were fascinated by the Chefs culinary skill..the ingredients were fresh seafood imported from Australia. . the accompanying sauces were interestingly creative. ..we had the tastiest soup to tease our appetite.The pizza we had was one of the best throughout our gourmet experience. .we enjoyed such fine dining in a truly stunning ambiance of attentive customer service as well

A lovely rustic restaurant serving reasonably priced set lunch as well as ala-carte, which is pricier. My favourite lunch choices are their hot-pot set & western set. Food is healthy and display is interesting & appetising. It is the few outets that serve healthy & organic food yet is not vegetarian. For their hotpot set, If you prefer vegetarian, you can opt to change the pork selection to quinoa balls. The mushroom tomato soup is a must-try

Most items on the menu is listed as organic,like our sparkling wine,salad,and coffee. However I doubt if our crispy pork knuckle and sausages fall into that category. Nonetheless, the pork knuckle is substantial and roasted to a crackling perfection. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable. Easily accessible from Lavender MRT statio
