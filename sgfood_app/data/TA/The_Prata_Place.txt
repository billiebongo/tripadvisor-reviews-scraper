Horrible artificial orange-pink coloured prata sauce, oily prata.
Sub-standard mutton curry...
Poor customer service.
Will NEVER patronize again!

Very nicely done prata. Not oily, crispy but not dry. Fish curry and chicken curry was good.
Mutton curry -so,so only.

Delicious and varied Pratas and Indian Food. The owner has a knack at creatively fusing modern tastebuds with the traditional Prata Dish. There is something for everyone.

Sadly fish head is out again, but meal was still good. Renovated outlet is more comfortable. Something seems out of place in that this sort of outlet normally doesn't have air conditioning.

Good meal, fast service, decent pricing given the location. Convenient at a residential neighbourhood. Good variety, with decent portions.

This is the first time i have been to this prata place although i have been to others at Jalan Kayu, Casuarina, etc. I find theirs by far the best. Slightly confusing on the signboard since when you reach there, it actually says 'Springleaf Prata Place'

Without fail... Guna and his team deliver the best roti prata or roti canai as it's called in Malaysia.Just try their plain prata and you'll be hooked.The crispiness of the bread will make you want another... and another.Do I eat in other restaurants? Of course.. but if I want prata. Nothing satisfies more than The Prata Place.#dropthemic#charmandre

I have been to this place more than 100 times over the past 3 years. It has never failed to disappoint me, except for the very rare poorly prepared teh tarik ice.The must try items here: Plain Prata, Milky Prata and Plaster Blaster.The pricing is about the same as your neighbourhood prata shops, or just a bit higher, but the fish curry and dahl (vegetarian) curry are both very good.If coming, do try the plain prata and taste for yourself if you also agree that the crispiness and taste are both better than your average prata shops. Currently, they have switched to a system where you pay first and then go to your table for the food to be served to you.Waiting time is short, even for a full house crowd (should not exceed about 20 mins the most). I personally like the milky prata. Those with a sweet tooth can consider the red bean prata also... not something that you can find at other prata shops elsewhere.But do take note that car-parking will be a problem if you drive here. May have to risk parking illegally or spending time parking at the nearest carpark which is some walkign distance away.In all, a great eating venue for small families

As the title says, the prata here is really done very well. Crispy and fluffy whereas most places tend to be oily and chewy. Only downside is that the curries and gravies they do are rather average which sorta cuts short the experience for me personally

A casual dining place for family. Has a wide specialty of Prata. The Prata goes well with curry mutton or chicken.Also have different types of thosai especially I liked the masala thosai and onion uthappam.Quite cheap and good quality. The sweet lassi will quench your taste buds. Open till 12.00 am
