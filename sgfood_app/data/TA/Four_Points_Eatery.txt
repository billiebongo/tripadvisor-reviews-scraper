A so-so restaurant to have meals at. the lunch spread was normal. nothing to shout about. the soups all tastes bland.Damage?? 50 bucks ++. one thing is the seafood selection very few. The cooked food section is more well stocked. But taste average. The only saving grace? the roast pork section, and the curry noodles, which has fresh succulent prawns in them
4
We enjoyed our buffet lunch at Four Points Eatery. The buffet spread included verv fresh seafood traditional CNY dishes like fatt choy with oysters, fish maw soup, roast duck, etc. Each table was served salmon yusheng. The Durian pengat was good
5
Fabulous service from the staff at The Eatery – specifically, Benjamin Pua, Lawrence, Marlon and Ameely. No once but twice have your staff at The Eatery provided exceptional service for 2 group events that I have held at The Eatery.The first was during the 2017 F1 Weekend (17 Sep) – I hosted about 23 friends and their kids for Sunday Brunch at The Eatery (outdoor area) and your staff were exemplary.The second occasion on 13 October 2017 – was for my parent’s 50th Wedding Anniversary. We held it at the Patio area of The Eatery. Again, Benjamin & his team were just wonderful in providing us with attentive service. They helped me with setting up the decorations for the evening.Benjamin and your Executive Chef took feedback from me and the changes they made to the menu selection for my parent’s party was just great. Thank You!

Though there not much varieties, food was delicious.. Cereal crab, black bean prawn. Lamp chop. Etc..
4
Although the food range was not too extensive, but it was sufficient to make a good enjoyable lunch. Wonderful ambience and service
4
Food was excellent with a good amount of choice. Offers both indoor and outdoor seating with good view. Service staff was friendly
5
We had the buffet lunch near the Chinese New Year period. Wide selection of food. Liked the Thai clam soup, Peking duck, and durian penget.
4
Pretty good and wide spread of food. Seafood was pretty fresh. Servers was prompt clearing the plates. Overall a nice place for lunch buffet
4
Seafood was very fresh with a pretty wide selection. My favorite was the seafood on ice. Prawns and mussels were sweet, oysters were opened on the spot upon order. Had a 1 for 1 promo with stan chart at $60++, great value for money !
5
We were impressed by the attentive and warmHospitality at the start till the end of our visit.The wait staff were very very polite with special mention to MELISSA and SUSILLA.They checked on us constantly and kept making sure we were well attended.The spread was not great but the service made us feel very welcomed and we willCome back soon! Keep it up
5
Overall, selection of food is good for the price. Restaurant is not so crowded which is somewhat a good thing
4
The Food there was good and so was the service of the staffs there. Extremely worth the price and value.
4
When I arrived, two baby chairs were not arranged although it was requested. We managed to rearrange the four tables (short of one) and chairs to accommodate all 10 of us. However, I received positive response from the waitress when my lobster was mistakenly removed from my table. I was offered new servings. We enjoyed the fresh oysters and the meal.
4
First visit was perfect, fresh snow crab legs, super attentive servers who kept topping up our water and Prosecco glasses and clearing our plates. Food was good, and we truly enjoyed ourselves.Second visit was a little less stellar, with crabs that were quite less fresh, but prawns were big and juicy. Service was busy and less attentive and we had to keep reminding staff to refill our glasses. All in all, still enjoyable.My dining partners say that the durian pengat is very good. If that’s your sort of thing. I enjoyed the rest of the desserts bar. :
4
The seafood is very fresh and the food variety quite a lot to choose. Only the lamb steaks are over cooked, tasteless and dry. The assistant manager, Alice is very friendly and helpful 
2
Limited spread, variety and offering of cooked dishes, Called it a seafood buffet but don't even have chilli or pepper crab.Can't find any roast/peking duck or satay.Can't find any cooked prawn dishes like sambal prawn No curry fish or chicken.Ambience and service only so-so.Was very disappointed with the food and experience.Not worth the price. Won't return for sure
3
Good variety of seafood but sadly, half way through the buffet timing, more than half of the dishes were empty out and we're not refilled for a long time until customers complained to the manager on duty. Thus, pulled down the rating to average
4
Attentive service, food and dessert variety ok. I don't eat beef so missed the chance to eat the live noodles section
4
Would be better to have more varieties for kids. Many dishes are spicy. Noodles self cooking station could be better. Juice and is not in the buffet as well. Cold Seafood and hot dishes are excellent.
5
With StanChart 1 for 1 promotion, you can’t get a better buffet dinner deal in SG which has the freshest and juiciest raw oysters shuckled on order !!simply awesome ..so this is definitely not my 1st, and not my last!! Hope that they have more of such 1 for 1 after 31st jan 201
4
Our first time in this restaurant. The food was good and the service was good too. Loved the free flow of Moscato and Prosecco. Will definitely consider coming back here again.
5
Seafood galore as promised. Only that the cereal crab dish was too disappointing. Deep fried and way too dry texture
5
One of our go-to places for our family gatherings. There is a good mix of western and Asian dishes to please everyone. Will be back to try their Sunday brunch soon, which has oysters and free flow of Moscato
5
Best option based on the price paidï¼Œquality food and service.Good for gathering and defenitely will visit again.
3
The food selection was average. Nothing really wowed me about the place. The staff were friendly at leas
5
We had breakfast and evening meal here on two occasions. The food was excellent. Freshly prepared and served quickly. Portions are very generous.The restaurant did get very busy at breakfast time
5
thank you Alice for sharing with my friend Josh and I about eatigo app. We sure will use it in future! God bless everyone and Alice! You are deeply loved by God! :)
4
Overall, the food was ok. I enjoyed the peking duck but the other food did not leave a lasting impression. The service I received from a lady name Ameely was exceptional. She was patient and helpful and I could see that she enjoyed what she was doing. Thank you, Ameely, for making my dining experience a great one

Visited Four Point coffee house in Four Point Sheraton Hotel Singapore last evening for buffet dinner. The food was good and tasty. I like the salted egg mushroom which was yummy.The buffet also came with half lobster grilled with cheese. Oysters were fresh. A good spread of Japanese sushi and sashimi; fresh herbal prawn soup; Tom Yum Soup; wide spread of salad n most importantly got my favourite durian penyet where I could taste fresh durian.I would go back there again. Thumbs u
5
Today is 2nd buffet lunch here this month. Enjoy the ambient. Good deal using credit card promotion 1-for-1 meal. Fresh rock oysters, love the free flow of wine. Nice food. Great place for friends gathering. Not forgetting warm friendly service by Alice and her team.Highly recommended
5
Good spread of food. Sashimi, oysters and crabs were fresh. Durian pengat was especially awesome! Great conversation with the person-in-charge, Alice. Excellent service and value for money. Wonderful way to spend a Sunday!
5
The service is good. Oysters are fresh. I also like the salted egg mushroom, sashimi and the durian purée and dessert are all so yummy.
4
The place is the cofee shop of the Gour Point by Sheraton hotel.. the place serves good breakfast and has options for basic Veg food .. some of the staff were a little uptight..
5
Had lunch there for 3 days during a conference. Food was very good but I loved the dessert most, in particular, the durian "paste". Full flavoured and authentic.
4
Helpful and friendly to people with special needs. Nice environment and atmosphere. Reasonable value for money.
5
Had an awesome dinner here with my Friends! The spread is good, serving staff and Chef are attentive and friendly, and we love the durian pengat especially! We were looking forward to the half Boston lobsters that are still as awesome as ever! Will be back definitely!
4
My coeliac husband had lots of choice here there was GF cereal, bread, fresh fruit, cheese as well as eggs and bacon all served well to avoid cross contaminatio
4
Variety of food was lesser than a full buffet restaurant but there are more worth the second try items such as crayfish, salted egg mushroom and lamb shark etc. Environment is quite and have a Singapore River view but may get very noisy when tour group enter.Staff was responsive and friendly who are keen to assist you with a big wide smile. Chance of going back: not really for food but for a slow meal in the lazy afternoon.Recommendation: Best for people with small stomach but love to see river view and people walking
5
Want to thank Alice and her team for their awesome service. Lots of variety of food and most importantly all tasted awesome. The Durian Pengat is a must try for durian lovers. Will return for more!
5
Excellent food , excellent service Team welcome was very warm  Alice & her team has taken great care for us & served us vegetarian food specially club sandwich with French fries it was really great that every day they made us good vegetarian food what ever possible & the breakfast was king size great ambience near river worth it
5
Even though the restaurant was very busy breakfast was no problem. Plenty of choices and the staff friendly and efficient.
5
Lots to choose from, both western and local dishes and excellent fresh fruits. If staying in hotel, not a bad start on your first morning.
5
Great staff, we were warmly greeted by every staff with a smile and ready to serve attitude despite us being 30 min. early for our lunch (restaurant only opens at 12 noon). They were still setting up the place and we were offered seats with drinks. They also took effort to play bring out the birthday cake with music and singing. Kudos to all the staff who will made this dining experience very memorable. Will return when there's an opportunity

I tried to reserve a table online, but the system was apparently set up in a way that it could not confirm a reservation in real time. I received a message that i would be contacted soon on whether my reservation was successful.After a wait of an entire day, i decided to call them instead of wait further. It took 2 consecutive calls before somebody would pick up the phone. The lady who picked up the call had problems conversing in English, and was impatient and rude.After much effort, i finally understood that they were fully-booked on the day i wanted to bring my family there for lunch. They also had received my online reservation request, but did not see the need to get back since they did not have a table for me. She was also very busy and had no time for further questions, bye. And true to her words, she hung up on me even before i could say anything further.Probably my worst experience with any establishment associated with Starwood

A lot has changed in this cafe since its Riverview Hotel days. Now rebranded as Four Points by Sheraton, the original coffee house has been renamed The Eatery.Buffet spreads line 2 sides of the restaurant with 2 more lines at its center. Primarily a seafood buffet spread, an ala carte menu is available. We chose to go with the ala carte menu. The mushroom soup served in a cup is rich and literally feels like you are slurping mushrooms. Highly recommended. The Caesar Salad came with a choice of chicken and salmon slices and the portion was huge and healthy. The Grilled Salmon was served on a bed of rice and was a satisfactory and complete main dish. May I offer a suggestion, though...that the team members are familiar with the Soup of the Day. We asked 2 team members but they were unsure and had to excuse themselves to check. Otherwise, all is good and we will return

Incentivised by Maybank's Credit Card 50% off promotion even for Sunday Brunch ($55++ per adult before discounts), my family decided to have our National Day Celebration earlier with a relaxing Sunday Brunch at the Four Points Eatery. We were seated next to the live Oyster Bar - Oysters were fresh and delicious. Also included was a free flow of Prosecoo & Moscato and Half a portin of grilled Boston Lobster with cheese per person. There was a wide selection of international food, hot dishes, cold seafood selection, sashimi station, salad bar etc. Dishes to try: Tom Yam crayfish, Cooked Scallop in shell, Cooked Salmon, seafood chowder in a pie? and Durian Pengat Service was great as used dishes are quickly cleared and empty glasses are topped up. Definitely a must try if you are looking for great food, great service at an affordable price and a very pleasant Sunday with family and friends

I have my son’s 21st birthday celebration at 4 points eatery on 28th Jul 2017 for dinner. We have total 56 diners. It was really a great place great atmosphere, great service, great foods and we had a great night there.Great Place Great atmosphere: The restaurant is bright, foods counter and seating arrangement is spacious, table setting is classic, neat & nice Great Service : Here I will like to thank Alice and Amily for their great assistance and very personal touch services. Especially Amily, she has been keeping me in touch 1 week before the event such as foods menu, cakes, place for decoration, seating arrangement, birthday songs, etc to ensure meet our expectation and events of celebration is in order.Amily specially arrange an empty table for our cake cutting session and allow us to do some decoration on the background. Our head count has increase from originally booking of 40 pax and slowly increased to 56 pax, Amily has patiently help us to add seat and make necessaryily arrangement accordingly.Our plate was changed and plain water was top up very often. They also help serve our guests with the Red wines and champagne we have brought.Great foods : There are quite many cooked foods, fired rice, laksa spaghetti, eggplant with shrimp, Mussel in Garlic, vegetable, salted eggs chicken, crispy spinach squid, beef lasagna, chicken ragout, sambal chilli fish, selection of dim sum, cracker with coconut & shrimp dip, pizza, sichuan soup, mushroom soup, etc, they are very good, not salty and not oily. Noodle station is self-mix of their signature laksa; which is really great. There is also one time serving of baked half Boston Lobster with cheese sauce. Fresh oyster is open on the spot for its freshness, Sashimi counter, salmon, Tuna and Tako are also freshly cut on the spot only upon request, live station served live prawn with herbal soup was great.There are also many other items such as various seafood on Ice bar, salad, appetizer counter, dessert, ice-cream, hot beverage drinks, etc. I strongly recommend to try their dessert of black forest cake and durian pengat.The buffet overall is value for money, I will say this is the BEST HOTEL BUFFET in term of the value we have paid.Once again I will like to thank Alice and especially Amily for their great help through out for us to have a wonderful & great night at Four Points Eatery!From : Gillian Po

In fact, when I stepped in Four Points by Sheraton Hotel after the transformation, I was awed or impressed by the excellent changes whether the lounge, Four Points Eatery and reception. It has a nice ambience, clean, modern and chic look. My 3 guests and I also enjoyed the Seafood Dinner at the Eatery on last Sun. Particularly like the durian pengat, raw oysters and laksa. We were well served by Customer Service Rep., Ms. Kim. There were quite a varieties of foods, desserts and starters which there would be some foods for everyone. Also like the freshly brewed coffee making machine. Look out for any promotions which even without it, it's also value for money. Indeed, a nice place to dine, meet up with friends and foods to enjoy, I will be back

We went there last night only for dinner.my bf chose the buffet while me ala carte dinner.both of us like the food.the young chinese man who served us during dinner was very nice & helpful person.sorry i forgot his name.we impressed with his good service so we gave him little tip
4
First time there after reading some reviews. The review pictures didn't really do it justice. But anyway it was a Maybank 1 for 1 promotion. What the heck thought I give it a try. Luckily I did.Turn out the food spread is decent for the price of $40.80 per head and after the discount, it was a no brainer. The service was efficient. The staff cleared the tables fast and the food was sufficiently adequate in the food trays. Not a crab fan but there were some there.Dessert was ok . The durian pengat was delicious especially since the season prices are astronomical. Had my durian fix there :-)Free flow of hot beverages as usual. Good lunch overall.Laurence the manager was friendly. Was attended by Rossa who was chatty 
5
Good spread, food promptly replenished. Excellent service by Alice, making my birthday lunch a delightful one 👍🏻 Highly recommended!
5
I like to share with u gals this hotel renders a goods service and friendly staff that makes me wanting to comes here 4times especially Alice she has a good attitude & good personal relationship with the customer in this hotel. I too love their foods very much especially their durian too is ridiculously delicious and prices are reasonable too. Seafood is delicious and fresh. Would recommend all to come and try at Four Points eatery in Sheraton.
4
They have great breakfast menu. Caters for all types of people and dishes. Their Seafood buffet over Xmas was perfec
4
Delicious food though not an extensive variety. Staff is polite and helpful. Love the cooked dishes as well as the appetizing spicy soup. The snowcrabs are one of my favourite, not forgetting the durain puree (desserts) too! A cozy restaurant with a relaxing outdoor seating next to the Singapore River. If you are lucky, you may even meet some otters! 50% discount for certain credit cards and Starwoods members
5
Yesterday we went down with our friends for a buffet lunch there. Excellent service. Special thanks to Alice who helped us with a more condusive seats. When she knew that it was one of our friends birthday, she kindly prepare a birthday cake for our friend. It is a sea food buffet eatery , but 梅菜扣肉 (the braised pork with preserved vegitables ) is excellent as well. The service is excellent, the food is definitely value for $. Currently there is 50% discount till Sept
3
Tried their buffet lunch on 17th June with 3 friends. Seafood section only served crabs, mussels, clams and Crayfish (小龙虾). Cooked food were very flavorful. Live pasta section was decent. Japanese corner only serve Salmon, tuna and octopus, be prepared to queue as the chef slices the fish upon request. Only 1 kind of sushi available. The only thing to crave about in the dessert section is their Durian pengat! The servers were all very attentive, water gets refilled, plates being cleared. Will try their Dinner buffet and update again
4
Tried the weekday buffet dinner as it offers 50% discount for Maybank credit card holders.I booked a group of 23 pax on 12th June 2017 for my colleague farewell dinner treat. We were approached by the Executive Chef Lewis who gave us guided tour of the restaurant and all its amazing food stations. His service was amazing and he was extremely friendly.Really wide spread with Asian delights and some other international food choices and the quality is generally pretty good and generous buffet with prices to match. Their cold seafood and sashimi section itself will probably make it worth it for majority of people.While at this level the buffet restaurants all offer unlimited fresh oysters, drunken live prawn etc. and one time served with baked half lobster.While kitchen and service staffs are attentive, friendly and ready to help.I’m a Laksa lover, personally felt that the Laksa gravy is slightly too bland and could be better,And desserts counter could be better,Overall a great experience!! Will definite intro to friends to come to Four Points Eatery
5
Spent the girls night out here and I would say that Me and my friends were very impressed with ambiance, food and service. We came in quite late, around 9ish and was expecting that food selection will be lesser at this time but I guess we just came in at the right time because theres a wide food variety of different cuisines. We were welcomed by the Manager named Marlon and he's very friendly and accomodated our every needs. He even guided us on which menu to start with. Of course he served us the the mouth watering lobster which was part of the deal. And not forgetting SARAH who's is very Friend also , Frankly speaking, not all buffet restaurants have this kind of service. I guess FOUR POINTS by Sheraton is lucky enough to have these employees who are very welcoming to guests
4
Buffet lunch offers 50% discount with Maybank credit card. Really value for $$. Food was good especially the sashimi, laksa with crayfish and durian dessert. Service was excellent. Would like to compliment Alice who treated us like VIPs. Her service was amazing and she was extremely friendly. We really had a great time
4
Tried the weekday buffet as it offers 50% discount for Maybank credit card holders. Surprised by the very good quality of the food they served. Guests will be served very fresh lobster, crayfish, crabs, clams, ... all top quality. Truly enjoyed it.
5
Very good food and environment!
Strongly recommended to come !
Friendly staff and helpful .
Durain is very good !
Dessert is good!
5
We had a fantastic and wonderful time in this hotel buffet lunch. The food are awesome and service are excellent. I would like compliment Ameely for her special service, good photo skill and her patience. Good work, keep it up. 3 cheers!

We are a family of 6 who just enjoyed our brunch today. Restaurant offered both indoor and outdoor dining. As it was fully booked, supposed to have a outdoor table. 2 days ago, helpful manager Alice informed that managed to arrange a table indoor for us. All staff are helpful and friendly.Clearing of plates are fast. The brunch was excellent. Price is inclusive of Oyster Bar, a one time served half lobster and Free Flow of Prosecco/Moscato . Oyster, seafood and sashimi are freshly prepared on the spot.. Price is reasonable with Maybank credit card which entitled to 50% OFF the bill. Environment was fine
4
We had a buffet lunch at 50% off and for the adults it comes with half a lobster, and includes proseco and sparking wine (I would imagine as much as you drink without over doing it). I certainly had at least 5 glasses. Great choice of mussels, fresh oysters, and scampi, sushi, etc., and to finish off, coffee and yummy cakes. So much to eat that we were still full at dinner time, and so skipped it altogether.After your meal, if you are lucky like us, you may even be able to watch a family of 12 otters in the river having their lunch of tilapia fish they caught themselves from the river
4
Very nice cosy hotel. You can Walk around river sit and look at river. There lot of people jogging in early morning. You can also go for jogging. There is nearby orchard road for shopping as well as food. Hotel has Japanese restaurant too. And river view cafe
4
I went here for breakfast, and the service provided by staff was not too bad. The spread for breakfast was great given their prices. Live Egg station is a plus point
4
We had a Friday dinner buffet there. $53++ I think. Very very good service. May not be super polished, but appeared very genuine. I remember Marlon and Sally in particular.Seating was a little cramped, as I think they had put some outside tables indoors. Food: actually quite a large selection. I certainly didn't have the ability to try everything. But it really is mostly seafood related. Maybe 80% seafood. Ingredients used were not cheap. They were mostly good. The oysters were very fresh tasting. My friend had more than a dozen. I'm not an oyster fan, but they were perhaps the best buffet oysters I've had in Singapore. But the really strange thing I cannot fathom is that apart from the oyster, no dish was really delicious. The tiger prawns were actually swimming in a tank. But they were cooked far too long. Chilli crab sauce was quite nice, a tad sweet. But main problem was the crab was mushy. Lobster had nice cheese on top, but lobster flesh no real flavor and ohh sooo tough. Desserts were ok but again not super yummy. We also had slice of cheese cake that was not from the buffet. Wow. THAT was super yummy. So strange. Anyway, it was rather crowded that night and many people seemed to be enjoying themselves. So perhaps my palate is just too spoilt.Definitely a place worth a try. I've uploaded some pix for you so u can decide better.

Very good deal! 50% discount for StdChart credit card holders. Car park voucher (1st hour free) available on request at front counter. Reasonable good spread of fresh oysters, sashimi, snow crabs, soup & salad, hot main dish,.. and deserts. Singapore river is just outside the restaurant
5
We dined at Four Points Eatery and were happy with the spread as well as service provided by the cafe staff. My mum particularly enjoyed the Rainbow Cheese Cake served that evening and in fact, that was the first time she ever enjoyed a rainbow cake so much. Without much hesitation, we called upon Four Points and enquired if the cake was for sale. We were told it wasn't but the chef kindly agreed to do it specially for us. We were very pleased with it and Yvonne, the Food & Beverage Secretary was very friendly and accommodating. We made several changes and be it through email or phone call, she was patient with the changes we requested for. Though I don't know the chef behind this, we would like to extend our greatest appreciation for this arrangement. My mum was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the cake very much
5
Had lunch on Vesak day, restaurant was fully booked but the food were being replenished fast. The buffet spread is very good be it raw or cooked food. The Manager Alice is a very nice lady, she move around all tables to chat with the diners to make sure we are enjoying our meal. She made us feel so at ease and she even address us by our names. Thumbs up to Alice. I will be back and hope to see you around on my next visit in Jun'17. In short, if you are looking for a place with good food plus good service, this is the right place
5
We had breakfast at this eatery which was so nice. Fast service, friendly staff. Food was amazing, coffee hot.
5
Celebrated my dad's 87th birthday here yesterday. We were served by Rosa and her supervisor, Alice. Rosa and her colleagues were excellent, clearing our plates and topping up our glasses without our having to ask. Alice was very caring and helped us arrange for our cake, candle and little birthday "tag" for our cake, told us to inform her when we were ready for the cake and arranged to bring it out when we were. Both Alice and Rosa chatted with us, without being intrusive, during our meal and I could see that they had rapport with the other guests as well.The food was good. My dad, who does not eat a lot, had 2 helpings of the crayfish laksa. My parents and I enjoyed the durian cake and durian penyet as well.A warm experience and we will be back
4
A typical hotel morning breaky served here. In my opinion nothing too fancy as they cater for about 20 different nationalitiesnice friendly staff
4
Despite not having any of the advertised sashimi or sushi available for the dinner buffe on the day, we thoroughly enjoyed the freshly shucked Canadian Oysters, lamb cuts and pasta. Drunken prawns and the durian pengat were also a highlight. Great value at S$63 all in for 2 pax (credit card promo
5
Really worth it. 9 of us had enjoyed the buffet lunch there. Fresh seafood and dishes. The drain pengat and laksa is best. Clean and spacious place. Friendly restaurant staff esp Alice and Pava. We had separately ordered a black forest birthday cake and it was really very good.
5
I visited the restaurant twice in a week!The buffet spread is unique and the seafood is really fresh. Apparently, the spread changes everyday and on my second visit and I could not find the slipper lobster laksa, which I had highly recommended to my party of 9. Chef Lewis and manager Alice then surprised our party by preparing 9 bowls of slipper lobster laksa!The staff in the restaurant are friendly and well-empowered to make our dining experience a personable and memorable one
4
It was an excellent buffet for seafood fans, especially oysters, yabbies and spanner crab. The Canadian oysters were shucked to order, and the yabbies and crab were meaty. Even the self-served laska was accompanied by crayfish. There were salads, sashimi, soups, hot Chinese and western dishes and desserts. Unfortunately it was missing a carvery station. The prosecco and moscato flowed freely. The quality and spread was excellent for $55++ per adult. We would like to thank Anlis for organising a dessert platter and candle when she learnt we were celebrating a birthday. Although the contents comprised of desserts from the buffet, we truly appreciate her sincere gesture. She even returned from her break to check that we received our dessert platter.
5
Was the last Saturday to celebrate my dad's birthday. For those that's driving do arrive early as car park lot's limited. If parking is available do redeem complimentary ticket from cashier upon paying your bill and if car park is full then just park at miramar or furama hotel and cross over.I must give high praise to the standard of service rendered by the serving staffs, cashier and cooks. Services staffs greet us the moment we are at the entrance of the restaurant, filled up our drink every time the glass were almost empty and cleared the dishes whenever we have finished the food. Cooks shucked the fresh oyster and serve it to us together with lemon and sauces, other cooks are stationed at spaghetti, sashimi and live prawn counter to serve.The grilled Boston lobster was a delight as the meat were juicy and well prepared. Spread were not many but were of very high standard. Alaska crab leg attracted queue and the restaurant was really generous ; replenishing this item each time it's empty. I am not a fan for lamb chop but I ate 3 pieces simply because the lamb chop was well cooked, tender and most important does not have the gamey flavor.Sashimi were extremely fresh and cook will only cut a few piece for every guest when requested. I love the herbal drunkard prawn soup counter; cook was really busy catching the live prawns from the aquarium and cooking it as this counter and the fresh oyster counter got lot's of order from almost all table.Desserts were limited but I felt that it's adequate as after all those main dishes most patron's stomach probably can't eat much dessert. Anyway, anyone who love durian should drop by to try the durian puree....it's un....un....unbelievable. Overall, this is a must go venue if you love seafood...especially lobster, Alaska crab leg, live prawn couple with outstanding service and nice ambience.....all thumb up to the crew and management of 4 point eatery.....you guys deserve the compliment and praise
5
Never know that we can have such good food and atmosphere for dinner. (value for money)We had received very good services from their staff. They are always very attentive to customers needs..Verity of Oceania Seafood Buffet spread with Asian and International selections.We love the complimentary half a portion of Grilled Boston lobster per person.The Fresh Oyster Bar and Sashimi Stations are also our favorite.This will be one of our favorite restaurant if you ask us to select
4
We went to the Seafood buffet on Friday night.Good service, staff very attentive to both the customers and the food served always topped up fast, fat and juicy oysters, fresh seafood which cooked upon ordering, the fried rice is nice, the fruits salad is tasty and good quality of breads. Too bad that the lobster's meat is tough.. Overall good experience, very satisfied. Recommended
