The concierge at the Regent recommended this for authentic Peranikan food. Naz, our waiter, asked questions about our food restrictions and preferences and then guided us to an excellent array of wood. Authentic atmosphere, great service, wonderful food. Very much recommend a visit.

Wandered in by chance. Very inviting and solicitous staff. Typical Peranakan food which was very good and modified in spiciness to our tolerance. Interesting old Singaporean setting and artifacts.

My friend in Singapore brought me to this restaurant, the decor was interesting and photogenic!
Food was a mix of Malay and Chinese and worth a try!
5
The best place for dinner. Very tasty cuisine, service at the highest level, the best place to try the peranakan's cuisine.

Lovely interior decoration reflecting the Peranakan image. Good place to bring visitors and good food
5
This was really very good. Great experience and very authentic. We enjoyed it very much. Special atmosphere which gives you the feeling being in Singapore 100years before. Very friendly and good service! Love this place and will come again.

The food was mediocre and while the place is overflowing with rich history; the ambience is dead. You have to pay for:RiceWaterChili Savories Almost everything except napkins You may not and cannot pack unfinished food so order wisely (as we were told). And... you must leave sharp by 9.30 and they serve your desserts even if u are still having dinner. Kudos to the service staff for trying to make it work. Go somewhere else for food as there are many other places in Singapore with good peranakan cuisine.

True Blue is located close to Peranakan museum in Singapore. Peranakan means descendants of early Chinese migrants who settled in Malay Peninsula. In other word, peranakan is said to be nonya cooking. It was first time for me to taste none cooking. "Blah keluak" is one of brown nuts that grow in Indonesia and Malaysia. It was used in a spicy curry. We went to the True Blue in a business group so that e could share plates. Deserts: pineapple tart is wonderfu

We ordered Ayam Buah Keluak, achar and crackers (appetiser), wing-bean salad, banana flower salad, sweet potato leave veg for dinner. The food was served lukewarm (like it had been sitting in a pot for a while). The salad and achar was tart and too tangy, as if the Chef had an overdose of vinegar and tamarind that evening, The red date and longan tea was served lukewarm. The service was lukewarm too! We did not finish the food. When we offered feedback to the wait staff, they said, "this is how it is supposed to taste". My Mother has Peranakan heritage and grew up with the cuisine as a daily staple and this is not how it is supposed to taste. I don't mind small portions as Long as the food is good, but in this case we ended up paying $150 for a lacklustre meal that left us more hungry after than when we first came in. We will not be going back. The achar made by the Nasi Lemak auntie in the Holland Village food court is 10x better than what we had at True Blue
5
We ordered the buah keluak, ikan garang assam and otak.
For dessert, we had durian chendol and sago gula melaka.
Compliments to the Chef and team - 6 stars Peranakan cuisine.
6 stars service from Dorothy, James and team.

Expensive n served all food including steam rice less than luke warm. Everything chargeable including small dish of achar! Place is well done up to give a Peranakan feel but the food needs to be checked by the owner who set it up initially! What is real Peranakan? Warm hospitality serve with pride n some dishes take days to prepare in advance. To serve the chap Chye cold, the Ayam buah keluah cold, Assam Prawns Luke warm etc is really putting this place to shame! For almost $80 per person lunch a la carte, NOT worth even if it’s a Michelin Star restaurant. NOT worth it at all
1
Supposed to be a Michelin Star Restaurant. The place is nicely done up considering the shape of old shop houses. Air con was also just right. But the food is just not worth the pricey prices. Ordered Chap Chye, Assam Prawns, Po Piah, Ayam Buah Keluah, achar, longan tea, white rice. Except for the Assam Prawns, nothing was served even like warm! Absolutely unacceptable. The worst was yet to come. They have only 1 toilet for male/female. Still ok it if was kept dry n clean. I went into a totally wet toilet n an open bin full of used tissues... absolutely unacceptable.Management needs to do something..

Dining in this restaurant transports you into a typical Peranakan home. The foyer of the home doubles up as the reception area before you are led into the main dining hall. The Cabbage stewed with glass vermicelli and mushrooms, Wild Pepper Leaves Omelette, Fish Fillet in Vegetable Curry and a Chendol were our orders and they were excellent choices.The service, tasty dishes and lovely ambience are its selling points
5
Step into this charming restaurant and you are instantly transported into a Peranakan home of old. The foyer fronting the restaurant doubles up as the reception area. The staff then walks you into the main dining area where here, once again; the area is immaculately decorated.The menu is extensive with typical Peranakan dishes, nicely grouped, with offerings such as appetisers, main dishes, desserts, etc. My partner and I chose the Cabbage stewed with glass vermicelli and mushrooms, Wild Pepper Leaves Omelette (a recommendation from the service staff), Fish Fillet in Vegetable Curry and a Chendol.Some may find the prices a little steep, but the service, tasty dishes and the restaurant’s charm and ambience make up for it

I was here for dinner with my mother and her best friend. I heard lots of great feedback from my colleagues about this restaurant serving authentic Peranakan food, so I thought I'd treat my mother to a meal here, and her friend is a Peranakan so I figured she'd be the best judge of the food we ordered.The restaurant is just a stone-throw away from the Peranakan Museum and has a beautiful old-school decor from the outside in. I can understand how non-Singaporeans (especially my colleagues from Europe and America) would be easily impressed by the decor and feel that they have travelled back in time for the days of colonial trading just by sitting in the mail dining hall. There are plenty of Peranakan-style antiques hanging from the ceiling and hung up on the walls, so a big thumbs up on the ambiance!We ordered a few signatures and the food was great. Their Ayam Buah Keluak (Chicken stewed with black nuts) was delicious and their Jantong Pisang (Banana blossom salad with cucumber and star fruit) was refreshing. We also ordered their Bakwan Kepiting (Crab and chicken meatball soup) and Kangkong Belachan (Water spinach fried with shrimp paste) but both did not demand for a shoutout. Our server recommended us to order their Oh Chien (Peranakan style oyster omelette) - not on their menu - but it was a bit of a let down. I have travelled to Melacca and Penang before and I felt this Oh Chien could not compare. Mind you, if the server was recommending this dish, there should be a guarantee that the dish has a kick and is able to have our tastebuds dancing. I was overall pleased with the food, but the three of us expected more.The down side of our meal was the price. I am not one who complains about price. I am willing to pay for good food and a memorable culinary experience, but dang, this place needs a fair warning about the price of their dishes - let alone a glass of water! They charge SGD1.00 per glass of water and another SGD1.00 if you need a refill. I mean, come on: which restaurant in today's age charges you that much for plain water, and again for re-fill? It's just plain water, not like it's with a slice of lemon or flavoured with any other sliced fruit? Their signature tea is a longan and red dates tea (which is wonderful at the first pour of hot water, but naturally gets diluted as you refill) is charged at SGD4.00 per person and I admit I was disappointed when the waiter wanted to charge more just to refresh the pot. Food wise, the portions are extremely small. The pictures of my dishes do not do justice to how small the portions actually are in real life. I can also see other negative reviews on the portion size and prices - so it's somewhat comforting to know I'm not the only one who felt this way.The bill came close to SGD150, which was a bit of a shock because we could have had a feast elsewhere but at least we got to tick this off our bucket list (especially after winning a Michelin Bib award). We would have stayed for dessert but we all agreed that we would have been better off getting coffee elsewhere. We even placed bets that the cafe wouldn't charge us SGD1.00 for a cup of water. I think there are better Peranakan restaurants out there to maximise your dollar's worth. Nevertheless, the food is great but I will not be coming back. PeraMakan in Marina Square offers Peranakan food in bento-like set meals that are equally as delicious and at SGD15-25 per set. Otherwise, there is IndoCafe along Scotts Road. Now those are worth going back to

We found the Trip Advisor Reviews on this place to be spot on. Small portions, added charges for everything, even a single glass of water (refills one dollar), etc. However, the black nut chicken is DEFINITELY worth the experience, as are the veggies in candle nut sauce. The tea is a nice compliment, but be sure to request they make it 'not too sweet'. Best to stick with these solely Peranakan dishes. Skip anything that is mostly Malay (like beef rending) or mostly Chinese (like squid with sweet sauce) as the flavors were below average, and Singapore is filled with hawker stalls serving the same dishes that are cheaper and much tastier

This is the 2nd time we've dined here. The first was about 2 yrs ago, for lunch. Portions then were huge and very tasty, but I remembered it was way too spicy, even for a local person. Never mind although very spicy, food was good so we gave it a 2nd chance, but it got worse.My husband & I brought 5 guests from 2 countries for a dinner (total 7 pax), wanted to give them a Peranakan cuisine treat. PORTION & PRICE - portions were super small, for example when you see my first photo with dish labelled Vs. bill attached, one can understand what I meant by super small and super expensive. Dish no. 1 was a bowl of commonly available vegetable Chap Chye meant for 2 portions @ 30 Singapore Dollars!Dish 2 was a bowl of Ayam Pongteh (for 2 portions), mostly gravy and a few pieces of chicken at S$40. Dish 4 was Udang Goreng Petai - a bean dish with 3 miserable shrimps for $25. COOKING - to be honest the food wasn't that bad. I am familiar with this cuisine and find food here still quite nice but was a bit watered down. The only thing truly nice was the Ayam buah keluak.SERVICE - Rude. Few minutes to 9pm they they told us last order at 9pm. I did not hear them say they were closing at 9.30 pm SHARP. At 9.30pm while my husband was still eating, they did not ask but removed the dishes right in front of him and our guests. I could not believe my eyes. They did it again and this time I called the lady back to return the dish. She didn't look too happy and NO apology given. Even our guests commented staff was rude. Is the country under war curfew that the staff needed to throw patrons out at 9.30pm??For the price they charge, it's supposed to be an upmarket dining place but the attitude and service is not acceptable, not anywhere in the world. We've dined at Michelin star restaurants, etc. Even cheap coffee shops treat customers way better. Guess who was to pay for dinner? Yes, my husband the humiliated host. Dining here is not even day-light robbery. It is eat with stress, humiliation and empty your pocket with duress! Never ever dine here again. There are other much better Peranakan cuisine places to go in Singapore. Situated just next to the Peranakan Museum, it is truly misrepresenting the Peranakan tradition, the Straits born people, a shame to the Museum and ultimately a shame to Singapore.Total bill: S$38

There seems to be so many mixed reviews about True Blue. Its true that they charge for everything including tap water but honestly its only $1. Not a huge deal. The service was also good. Our waiter recommended some great dishes to us after we told him it was our first time. He checked in on us a few times to see how we were liking the dishes. I've never had Peranakan food before so I cant really say if its authentic but everything was delicious. I was kind of expecting all the dishes to taste similar but everything was unique and delicious. I dont remember the names for the dishes we ordered but we got a banana leaf salad, fried spring rolls, sweet potato leaves with prawns, chicken with black nut, fish curry, and a beef dish
1
I have been to this restaurant several times over the years and have not been impressed. To call it "True Blue" is misleading. Foreigners who think that this is authentic are sorely mistaken. This is not real Peranakan cuisine. I am a fifth generation Baba whose family has been in Singapore since the 1820's, so I have some experience of what Nonya cooking is like. It is a mystery how it got into the Michelin Guide.Recently, my wife and I were invited to have lunch there. To our pleasant surprise, the food had improved. Today my wife went back with the intention of making a reservation for a group of friends (she has been a coordinator at the neighbouring Peranakan Museum as well as a member of a group of ambassadors' wives). The person she met said, and I quote, "I have a lot of guests, I don't have time for you. Write in." Then he went off. My wife was flabbergasted by this appalling attitude. We have lived and dined all over the world and this is absolutely the WORST service we have ever encountered. This was on top of the rather brusque treatment she got when inquiring over the phone beforehand. She thought (mistakenly) that it would be easier in person.Needless to say, neither my wife nor I will ever consider entertaining there. There are better Peranakan restaurants where the staff know how to be polite. My wife had thought of bringing her Museum contacts as well as her diplomatic friends to True Blue. This will NOT happen. If you treat potential customers so shabbily you should not be surprised if they do not bother to come again.Definitely not recommended

On a short business trip to Singapore, I invited colleagues & friends to try Peranakan Cuisine. In True Blue, we found authentic & tasty fare. Our host Naz, made this an even more special occasion.
1
The food is decent which explains the bib recommendation but honestly there are much better Peranakan places to go to in singapore who will give you same or better quality food without the grief of the terrible attitude. Peranakan culture is famous for their hospitality but true blue fails in so many ways. Where do I start? These are just a few of the gripes. Y1. Before you start, you are reminded that you have to pay for water and rice. 2. The serving portions are abstemious to the point of being ridiculous.I. 3 prawns per serving? Come off it! My Peranakan grandma is turning in her grave with shame. Ii. A serving of rendang that is not enough for 2! Iii. If you run out of shells for the kueh pie ti, they tell you that every extra shell will cost you $2'iv. If you run out of the Chilli sauce and you want a smidgen more, they will charge again. Basically, any kind of goodwill restauranteurs provide , they will not hesitate to write you a bill, including the plastic container for the doggy bag you ask for. 3. If you are vegetarian, forget it. They will tell you quite bluntly that they cannot make any accommodation which is a complete rubbish as we all know, a decent Peranakan kitchen can prepare anything from scratch in 3 minutes. 4. You ordered 10 dishes and ask if you could have them in two stages and they will tell 'no! That's not how we, peranakans do it!" Listen here you arrogant twits (to the owners) if you are reading this, I come from a Long line of Peranakan family and honouring our guests is the first principle - you bring shame to Peranakan culture. 5. By 9 pm, they tell you that you have to make the last order ( this is Saturday), as they close at 9.30. At 9.30 they promptly start switching off the lights. Between 9 and 9.30, they start splashing water in the bathrooms so you can't even use it! 6. And serving Sweet longan tea before the meal? Since when is this Peranakan? It is sickly sweet and it ruins the meal. The tea is only served on festive occasions and after a meal, if at all but - never before it. (Btw - if they serve you crackers - be warned - they are a dollar each, I repeat - each - not a serving. 7. As for the name? True blue? That's as Peranakan as Mel Gibson. Okay, if I sound miffed about this restaurant it is because I've tried my best to see it's good side and any effort to maintain a threatened tradition deserves support. I am always happy to pay for good honest food but when arrogance and rudeness is paraded as an excuse for authenticity, enough is enough. If you are checking are Peranakan cuisine, please excuse this, there are others that are more deserving of your patronage and will welcome you in the true Peranakan fashion. At 50-80$ per head you can do way better in singapore. True blue is truly dismal.

We had a communal style dinner - the portions were miniscule, such that each diner only had one piece of meat/sambal prawn for e.g. The food itself was decent but for the price (SGD 70/person for about 5 dishes), expected larger quantities. $2 just for 1 portion of chili, which should be staple given that we are talking about Peranakan food. Service was okay. There are definitely better Peranakan restaurants in SG, this one is clearly meant for tourists/expats
5
We had lunch at True Blue and it was fantastic! Our server was "Naz" and he was outstanding! We were the only ones in the restaurant on this day for a later lunch and it was truly like we had a celebrity experience. Naz was Mr. Hospitable, made great suggestions (which we took him up on) and catered to our every whim. He asked us what we liked and what we did not like and developed his suggestions based on what we said. Thank you, Naz!I did not have my notebook with me on this day, so my notes are sketchy on our food dishes (which were all wonderful), but here is what I can tell you from the receipt. We had two Longan teas (Naz said a must do and that if it is too sweet for your taste, they will make it less sweet, which we did ask for less sugar on the next go round), one order of Udang Goreng Assam, one order of Ayam Buah Keluak, one order of Jantong Pisang and two orders of rice (free flow). My sketchy notes from my receipt had the words "chicken dish with black walnut?, prawns, banana vegetable dish)
5
True Blue was a fantastic culinary experience. First off, if you have nothing else, you need to try the Ayam Buah Keluak! A dish that looks like meat and rocks soaked in creosote, it has an amazingly rich, strong flavor unlike anything I have eaten. It will fill you up to the point that two of us did not need 3 other dishes (2 would have been more than enough for two people).The decor reminded me of going to a dinner party in an old Victorian style house. You enter through a porch into a dining area occupied by large wooden chairs and tables. The Chinese accents though throw off the Victorian analogy. Service is attentive and helpful with suggestions on what to try. The only small irritant was the one dollar charge for still water. Please just bake it into the cost of the meal items
5
We were taken here by a local Singaporean who knows good restaurants. Upon arrival, we walked through a vestibule area decorated in fine Chinese antiques and into a beautiful restaurant illuminated by natural sunshine which flowed into the centre of the restaurant - along with roof furnishings which seemed to date back to the colonial area with those delightful wooden shutters (see attached photos). We knew we were in a quality restaurant.The food was tasty, fresh and authentic. The staff were accommodating, and didn't mind posing with us for photos.Our host paid, but I would say the price range would most probably fall into the medium to high bracket.All up, it was a memorable experience and a wonderful introduction to Peranakan food
5
My wife and I enjoyed the authentic Peranakan food served at True Blue. The decorations that alots sunlight into the back yard created the nostalgic feelings.Special dishes are the pork ball soup, chicken buah keluak, ngoh hiang and the ice dessert. Come and enjoy lunch and dinner with ample parking at Fort Canning
5
The chicken with black nut was truly new and different. The staff were extremely friendly and very concerned that you enjoy your experience. The satay was crispy and moist all at the same time. And, the piano was an unexpected gift. The food was as authentic as you can find. Listen to your concierge when they recommend this one.
5
Beware ill tempered negative reviews from TripAdvisor amateurs. This restaurant fully justifies its Michelin Bib Gourmand status. The food and the presentation is excellent and the setting and the ambience are exceptional. Value for money is of the highest. There are complaints about the add-ons. However, charging for tea, rice and krupuk etc. happens to be standard in non-European restaurants in Singapore (i.e. most restaurants) and the charges are insignificant. And, by the way, they refuse tips notwithstanding excellence of service. It's a showcase of traditional Peranakan food. Highly recommended and a must for every visitor to Singapore
2
Upon arrival tea, shrimp crackers and pickled vegetables were placed on our table without any comment. At the end of the meal $16 ++ was added for these items which we did not even like. We complained about the lack of communication regarding what we thought were complementary products and they did nothing. Ambience nice. Food whisked out within a minute of order, obviously from a warming section as was not hot. Shame this could have been much better. Will not return
5
Love the Ayam buah keluat, red dates tea, kueh pieti, chap Chye, rendang, Assam prawns (deshelled!!! ) , prawn crackers, spicy fish fillet.
5
This is the real thing. Peranakan home-cooked food served in an authentic and beautiful setting. The food is spicy, but the beer is ice cold. The service was helpful and gave us good recommendations for folks unfamiliar with Peranakan dishes.
2
We had the set lunch menu. It was bland and very ordinary. The beautiful setting did not offset the common food.
5
Had been to the restaurant last May and whilst in Singapore this month decided to go back as the food was so good.Not disappointed at all with the decision - good attentive service, suggestions of possible choices discussed without waiter being pushy and what we decided upon in the end was well presented , delicious and whilst not cheap excellent value for money
4
It's located next to the Peranakan Museum at Armenian St, serving authentic peranakan cuisine in a very classic / traditional peranakan environment. I considered it as kind of fine dining as the portion is small, price is on the high side and very particular on the presentation of the food. The food is nice and in general a good dining experience.
1
Please do not bother unless your happy to pay way over the odds for small portions bad service and cold food. They will even charge for tap water. The museum next door is worth a visit but do not bother coming here felt totally ripped off there is far better in singapore for quarter of the price
5
A friend from Hong Kong found this place. What a find!!Set in an old house and feeling very lived in - it is fantastic.The service was superb. Knowledgeable and professional. The food. ... I'm no expert but I know what I like- and I loved it! My friends, however, from Singapore, KL and Hong Kong are - and they all loved it too! We all especially loved a dish made with black nuts that were cut in half and prepared over a day or two. I can't remember the name but they were superb!Excellent. Highly recommended
4
On my last trip to Singapore I went to explore the Peranakan Museum which was recommended to me by a friend who lived in Singapore for 3 years. Very interesting to learn about the history of Singapore and its inhabitants. Just next door you will find True Blue Cuisine. Excellent service and welcome. Nice decoration and ambience. The recommended food was delicious; Chicken with black nuts sauce accompanied with a Pomelo salad. And I could not resist the Pineapple tart.
5
Traditional food within a traditional building and I thoroughly enjoyed the the combination of flavours. However they do ask if you like spicy and if you do say really spicy as I feel that they may play it safely with foreigners. I wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for my friends that live in Singapore so if your visiting and want something really tasty and tradional come here
4
We had a fantastic night here with both very welcoming and experienced staff and fantastic food. We had a broad selection of dishes and not one was a let down at all! We would all recommend this place when your in Singapore but suggest you book to avoid disappointment!
4
We enjoyed the authentic Peranakan food. The food is tasty. The atmosphere is great, with lots of Peranakan decor such as Peranakan furniture and antiques.
5
Really the best peranaken restaurant I've been to. Furnished with period peranaken decorations and fittings, very authentic. Possibly slightly too many things as it was on the edge of looking cluttered. Menu encompassed all the classic dishes, each cooked to perfection, though the portions could have been a tad larger. Service was excellent - just at the right level. Not cheap, but recommended.
3
Nothing is bad. The room remains lovely. But some how the whole experience no longer wows me. The long beans are good, but not as good as the long beans I have had at other Singapore restaurants. The turnip cups are elegant and delicate and lovely, but not extraordinary. The black nut chicken (Ayam Buah Keluak), which should be a mind-blowing introduction to Singapore Peranakan cuisine, was good, but, again, not extraordinary. My guest was suitably wowed, but I was not. And there were surprising little off notes: There is only one beer on the menu, which is surprising now that there are so many excellent local choices here in Singapore. Worse, the beer is Tiger, and a small mug of Tiger here costs about what a pitcher costs at happy hour in a tourist trap down along Boat Quay. Even a glass of tap water cost $1.00. So, yeah, good but not great, and no longer great value
5
Fantastic, passionate service with beautifully flavoursome food. We had the ngoh hiang starter (which was so good we ordered a second plate!). We shared the famous ayah bush keluak (chicken with black nut), and the fish fillet curry (nice heat). The kids enjoyed the ayam goreng. I tried the true blue sling (like the Singapore sling but with a twist of lemon grass!) and thoroughly enjoyed it. We finished with a sago sago, pulot hitam (sticky black rice) and a pineapple tart. We enjoyed some longan tea throughout the meal. Just gorgeous from start to finish. It was a quiet oasis in a bustling city. Highly recommended
4
The food at True Blue compares well with the best of peranakan food in KL and Melaka.It has great atmosphere, housed in a fine old house with peranakan furnishing.Their signature chicken keluak is average, but their versions of pineapple prawn, otak-otak, rendang are very good. Forget the desserts - the chendol and black pulut are so-so, the santan and gula melaka are not savory enough. Below average. Be warned, you are going to eat a lot of fluffy rice - it is the perfect accompaniment to the nyonya dishes!They charge for everything, even water! A shame really, just made customers feel cheated after delivering a good meal.
4
Very good restaurant serving a fusion of Malay, Singapore and Indian Cuisine. We ate as part of a large group and had a set banquet which gave us an opportunity to taste a good number of dishes. All were really freshly prepared and very tasty, staff were very helpful and talked us through dishes and persuaded us to try some more adventurous dishes, all of which were excellent
4
We can experience the authentic Peranakan cuisine at True Blue. Little premium prices for foods but very good prices for good wine. 진정한 페라나칸 음식을 맛볼수 있어요. 페라나칸 박물관에들렸다가 가면 더 좋습니다. 바로 옆에 있고요. 음식가격은 양에 비해 좀 센 편입니다만 와인 가격은 매우 좋습니다. 2008년 빈티지를 70 싱달러쯤 주고 마신 것 같아요.

Situated in a charming shophouse, this restaurant is hard to miss if you do not know about it beforehand. My family and i thoroughly enjoyed my birthday lunch. Food was authentic, but came in small portions. We had to double-up most of our orders. The sambal fried fish filets and sweet and sour prawns were our favourites. Fish was fresh, and sambal was "power". The prawns were fresh and the gravy was to die for. The unlimited servings of rice really helped us mop up all the gravy.Service was attentive and friendly. My only gripes are the small prices and steep prices. But i understand it takes time and effort to create such layers of flavours!Highly recommended for any occasion, especially if you have overseas guests
5
I reached earlier with my daughter who is 3 years old carrying my own bag and the birthday cake. The restaurant was kind to have us seated early and served us tea and crackers. I ordered the food prior while waiting for my family to arrive. My family ended arriving 45 mins later due to a bad jam on the road. My dad started serving my mum n himself tea and waiter saw it and was so apologetic that he missed it as he supposed to be serving us the tea. Their staff are very attentive, they walked around very often to serve the tea.The chief waitress is like the matriarch of the house. She is so nice and warm. She asked prior if we are celebrating a birthday and cutting the cake in the restaurant. So she informed me that they can prepare the cake and a birthday song will be played by the pianist!Yes, live music is on for about 2 hrs and the sound of the music is really calming and beautiful.Food are small serves so great for 2 pax or small eaters. But if in a group, they will advise you to either add meat to the individual dishes or add dishes.One of the good Peranakan food in Singapore. Though pricey but the service, ambience and taste of Peranakan is strong.
5
Singapore, as a former part of the Straits Settlements, has become proud of its Peranakan heritage. This is the fusion of Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures that occurred here in the 18th and 19th centuries. This terrific restaurant is just next door to the Peranakan Museum on Armenian Street and is a must for lunch or dinner after your visit there. In a former Peranakan mansion, it is a museum in itself, and the wonderful, knowledgeable and friendly staff will be more than happy to guide you in the specialties and curiosities of Peranakan cuisine. Yum
4
Quite tasty-- very different but quite good. Setting is also very nice. Enjoyed the experience- service also good. A bit pricey
5
We had a lovely evening at this restaurant.They serve amazing PERANAKAN cuisne-its a mix between Malay and Chinese food. The food served were delicious and generous portions. Pretty impressed with an old lady must be in her 70s serving food to us. A memorable evening.
4
A good experience and a chance to try other foods. Attentive staff who took the time out to explain the menu and make really good recommendations.
5
Exceptional service and next to the Peranakan Museum with authentic cuisine of the Peranakan culture. A warm a cozy environment with a beautiful setting. We would highly recommend the Chicken with Black Nuts. A real delight for any who visits.
5
This is a wonderful Indonesian restaurant with great dishes and typically Indonesian style service! You can have a great meal for a very reasonable price: go and try it!
4
Ate here with a group tour, so not sure about the cost. It was a set menu with a variety of dishes served on the table. The amount was ample and the tastes were interesting. It seemed the obvious choice after visiting the Peranakan Museum. Idid not see a menu but was told that it is quite expensive, so a look at the menu before going in might be a good idea
5
After living in Singapore for 2 years I was getting ready to leave and needed to make sure I did the "musts". I went to the Peranakan museum, after which I was hungry and wanted to see something else... I find myself staring into a window of an old shophouse which turned out to be a boutique Peranakan cuisine restaurant! I was served by a delightful man who recommended the chicken with black nut stew. Food was good - leaving full, satisfied and happy. Meanwhile the piano continues playing in the background - live music, not a recording. Very pleased.
5
The staff here made us feel very welcome, made recommendations for dishes to try and showed you how to get the best flavours from the dishes. Do try the traditional peranakan dish, chicken with black nut.With a lovely family history the staff are happy to share, along with the photos, beaded shoes, bags and ornaments on display. A wonderful example of peranakan culture and architecture which the staff are proud to share. All that with great food
2
Ever since my personal experience dining in True Blue Cuisine for a business lunch, the words True Blue Cuisine is officially an adjective meaning something absolutely minuscule in my dictionary. To paraphrase that extensive analysis, it is an expensive restaurant which serves tiny portions.It brings up a question : what is the value proposition for a restaurant like True Blue Cuisine? With some fancied-up versions of what are traditionally inexpensive ethnic Peranakan cuisines, price hikes come with no higher quality ingredients nor nicer service.The question really is whether it would be worth it. And the answer is: never, for almost all of us.This is the true truth as I say it as it isâ€

My first experience of perankan cuisine and I have become a fan. A quaint place with beautiful decor, live music on a piano, staff which takes your choice into account and recommends good food, to souvenirs that can be purchased as a memory. The perankan food was flavor full.

My wife took me to this place knowing that I love peranakan cuisine. Very nice and cozy place, decorated with old baba and nyonya pictures and furnishings. There is also an in house pianist. Food is excellent and authentic peranakan. Must try - ayam buah keluak and fish fillet cooked with sweet and sour pineapple sauce. Strong rich assam flavor. Great place to come.
5
Next to the Peranakan Musem is this marvellous restaurant that serves authentic ethnic foods from the Peranakan culture. These were the first Asians to settle in Singapore. The Chicken with Black Nuts is amazing along with the salad of banana blossoms and cucumber. Wonderful service in a beautiful setting

Excellent place for authentic pernanakan food in Singapore, situauted in an old renovated building, with very authenitc feel. The service was good but they will not give you any water for free, not even tap water. And even to refill the tea cup has a charge! However, the food was very good but a bit on a pricy side
4
The restaurant is housed in what appears to be a Peranakan house, decorated in that manner with antiques and all. Service was good. Food was very good, but we felt the portions were very small and it was rather pricey for the amount of food you actually get. But it is a unique restaurant which serves typical Peranakan food. A nice place to bring visitors for something different
5
I just about have the vib down for Singaporean restaurants. Everything is a charge, bread is a charge, etc.. This said, true blue is great. The staff was attentive, the food just as it should be. I had the Malay beef and a banana blossom salad, topped off with a durian dessert
1
The place looks inviting. Don't be fooled. Turned up for lunch at around 13:10. Be aware they close at 14:30 (fair enough) but they will rush you out at that time, telling you they are closing, even if you are finishing your overpriced meal. The overbearing waiter's routine and disinterested introduction "Where are you from?", "What food don't you like and I will recommend for you", is made before you've even had a chance to look at the menu. He has pre-prepared food to shift and wants to close on time, whilst earning maximum profit. He recommended beef rendang and chicken in black nut. The waiter obviously got the impression we were tourists (I'm not). The chicken comprised two small bony portions of thigh, with an insipid cold sauce. If, like me, you regularly eat delicious beef rendang in Singapore (Rumah Makan Misang, Pariaman, Warung M Nasir to name but three of many good venues), then you will be so disappointed to be presented with this small portion of cold tough meat, at six times the price.The waiter had asked whether I liked spicy food, I had said yes, no spice in either of these dishes. Bland, tasteless, not authentic. Tap water is charged at S$ 1 with no offers to refill, cold jasmine rice (which doesn't appear on the menu) is charged at S$ 3 per portion. To be fair, this was refilled, You'll need it given the size of the portions. Be warned, as you sit down, you will be confronted by a different waiter who will offer you a large pot of tea and some unappetizing looking poppadoms. You will be charged for these delights, although they are offered as though complementary. If you know your food and its rightful value, and appreciate good professional service, you will not enjoy this experience
1
Overpriced, tiny portions, and overbearing service. We were stared at by 5 or 6 staff throughout (seemed like family run with senior matriarch overseeing all activity) and the lighting was like 3 in the afternoon. Food ordered, came out in less than five minutes, almost all at once (I've had slower service at Maccas). Beef rendang the worst ever - tough, tiny and cold inside. All up for 4 dishes for 2 people, 1 glass (yes glass) of house wine and a bottle water, bill $124.54. Still hungry, fed and watered in well under 1 hour. A great disappointment as it came highly recommended
4
When you get into this place, you feel like in a different time and a different world. The dÃ©cor is sophisticated and a mix of Art Deco and Chinese/Peranakan photo and art. The cuisine is very nice, especially the Randan Beef and the black Nut Chicken. The portions are small but very tasty. It is not a cheap place - we paid 140 SGD for 3 for lunch without taking drinks but it is worth it for a special occasion
5
From the beginning, we knew we were going to have a memorable experience. A man we believe was the owner came to our table, looked us squarely in the eye and stated, "Tell me what you won't eat, and I'll tell you what I'll cook for you." A non-seafood eater, I was happy to hear him say that he'd prepare a tomato salad and chicken/black nut dish. When the dish arrived, it appeared to be a coal black stew. White rice was served and chicken was pulled from the bowl as well as huge black nuts, the size of golf ball and very hard. Puzzling for a moment, I was relieved when the waiter explained to use the tiny spoon to dish out the nut pulp through a tiny hole and then to mix that with the rice as well as spoon some of the black liquid over it. The dish was terrific--spicy but not painfully so. The chicken was tender. All in all, it was a marvelous experience. Afterwards, the owner showed us into a dining room with his display of intricate native beadwork--beautiful. We were appropriately appreciative, and he was then kind enough to give each of us a small print. Everyone should dine at True Blue
4
I have been to True Blue twice, both business dinners for 10 - 15 people. The variety of food was as good as the flavors! The wait staff was very attentive and willing to make suggestions. We shared a number of plates, but the various appetizers were the best part - try the "top hats"! The restaurant does not serve hard liquor, only beer and wine
3
Went there with my family, food was good but not great and pricy. But the staff were really attentive. The interior was nice and cozy. They don't serve pork dishes.. Only seafood, chicken and duck
3
Interesting decor and good but not amazing Peranakan Cuisine for a relatively high price.
Go here if you want a visitors Peranakan experience.
5
We booked online via email to dine in this restaurant. Everything was 6 stars. Fantastic food, service and experience. It is a must do when in Singapore.

But hardly any veg options and quite pricy for the offerings
Ambience excellent though
Near the museum in
5
I know this restaurant by guidebook.Thanks for guidebook,I can choose menu easy.If I have no guidebook ,I can't image dishes.I feel atmosphere of this restaurant nostalgic and homelike.Singapore cuisine,I ate for the first time. I feel very unique and good taste.Especially,the food in the seed smell unique nuts.Other dishes are also good. I was very satisfied
5
I was taken out here by business colleagues. Food was an excellent mix of fusions and served in tapas style portions. Excellent flavours and quality of ingredients. Good attentive service and you leave feeling you have eaten quality well but not over full. Lovely setting as an added bonus
5
This little restaurant is right next to the peranakan museum and serves authentic peranakan dishes. When deciding what to eat for lunch after experiencing the museum it didn't take long for me to decide to go in! The food was absolutely delicious and the staff attentive without being annoying. Inside is also air conditioned and is a bit of a sanctuary from the heat outside. I trusted my waiter and his recommendations and wasn't disappointed! If you are intrigued by the peranakan culture and wish to savour some of their food give this a go!
5
This is my second visit to True Blue. I usually like to try new restaurants during each visit to Singapore. But the food was so good here, I was excited to return. And I wasn't disappointed. Both dishes were excellent. The fish and chicken were both tender. We started with the fresh Prawn Crackers and Longan & Red Date Tea. Both excellent. Highly recommend to start your meal. If I were to find a complaint, the only thing would be the price of the dishes. A bit high for Singapore. But if budget is not an issue, definitely one of the best meals you will find in Singapore.....and there is PLENTY of competition
4
This is an all time favourite Peranakan Restaraunt in Singapore along with Blue Ginger. True Blue does a great fish head curry and is well known for their ayam buah keluak. We have been regular visitors for some years and the atmosphere is also charming. The portions are shrinking (like in other places) and there are stingy charges like charging for a glass of tap water. Hopefully the stingy charges stop and the portions stop shrinking as the food is generally great and the atmosphere is charming.
5
We were dying to try Peranakan food and were told about the True Blue. They accepted our reservation at short notice and we raced over and had some of the best food we have had in ages. Every dish was delicious in it own right but they were all complementary and I would go back anytime to have their famous chicken and black nut dish. It was extraordinary. We were recommended a wine which was incredible. It does close early and to a degree they do it the way they want to do it but this is fine as you can tell the food is their focus first and foremost. The only complaint I would make is in getting a taxi afterward but that is my 'beef' about Singapore generally! Loved the True Blue and would recommend it highly
5
We had a great time here. Service was great. Decent wine list. Not overly expensive.
Except for the king prawns. They were nice but not worth the cost.
5
Typical Peranakan cuisine. A must for everyone who wants to experience the real and authentic Singapore. The restaurant is beautiful and the food exquisite.
5
Fabulous food, very tasty, incredible service. A little bit on the pricey side but well worth it. We relied on recommendations from the staff and they were spot on.
5
We stumbled on this restaurant by accident and they were very obliging in providing us a late lunch. Our host introduced us to the most interesting tea I had ever had, based on longan and some thing else that was very aromatic and sweet. Very refreshing after a couple of hours of walking in the humid hazy Singapore streets. Service was efficient and the ambience excellent. It was a very refreshing break before heading on to the Peranakan museum a couple of doors up the street
5
I was invited to have a typically local business lunch. What a treat. Every plate was so delicious, not too much, but just enough to taste the great "fusion cuisine" od Singapore. My favorite was the crayfish. i can only recommend Treu Blue as it stands out by quality and authenticity
5
Had discovered True Blue when with a local colleague friend the night before and had ben so impressed I returned for an evening meal prior to my night flight back to the UKI had never experience the Peramakan cuisine before - a mixture of Malay and Singapore. I was guided through the menu and indeed the meal by a most charming Alyssa and the result was a culinary delight of the most unique flavours and textures. No wine, just their special fruit team and a Tiger beer.Charming, authentic atmosphere in this small traditional restaurant. Ideal place, especially if your can book one of the booths, for a special meal for 2-4 guests. Also a lovely meal for a private dinner.Will certainly return again. Was also presented with a card by my host in grateful thanks for my visit. Now you do not get that too often. Full marks
3
With an impressive budget a business diner for 20 persons. Wine was far below European standards, as a start. Food was a selection of the house. Eveything, so all 'courses' were brought to the table at once leaving hardly time for discussions - and the food gets cold. Quality was average, had better in Singapore. So quite overrated restaurant. Not bad, but that is something different than 'good'
5
This place was chosen by the organisers of the conference where I was one of the speaker. The restaurant prepared some very nice vegetarian dishes on special request. A tad expensive because they charged 58 SGD for a glass of wine (not even a full glass).
5
Great ambience, great service and great food.We visited this restaurant for my wife's birthday and the whole evening was a pleasure.We ordered several dishes we could share and the food was amazing.Price wise a little inconsistent but most dishes were very good value.My only regret was ordering the prawns. We had two dishes if these and each dish had two prawns.... I was shocked when I got the bill that each prawn was $15. It seemed rather steep to pay $60 ++ for 4 prawns. On top of that the waiter told us he had lowered the price because they were smaller than usual... Apparently usually $22.I thought that price was per dish not per prawn.I would still return and would also recommend to friends.... I would just not order prawns again.Also.... The live music provided by a lady playing the piano was delightful
3
Newly renovated - this Peranakan cuisine is authentic. Adjoining the Peranakan museum it should be. Opens at 1730 for dinner. The Portuguese influence is apparent, even having some of their wines on the menu. We had a spicy pomfret, squid Assam style (tamarind), potato leaves with prawns in coconut gravy and a pomelo salad. Steamed rice was included. Washed down with a dry Portuguese white wine. Service was very attentive. A lady tinkled on the ivories of a piano in an adjacent room to create an atmosphere of perhaps 60 years back.
1
Have been here for food with a hosting friend, and came back to check out the menu but the staff were extremely rude and chased me out as if I was loitering just because I wasn't going in to eat! What the heck!

An opportunity to try Peranakan Cuisine. Wonderful tastes you normally don't have an opportunity to sample. Recommend the
1
After a visit to the Perankan Museum, one is more likely than not to ask where the nearest Perankan restaurant is. One is then of course directed to this "True Blue" Restaurant, serving Perankan cuisine, situated only a few doors away. Please avoid this place like the plague! The food is soaked and swimming in sugary syrup, and the sugar taste overwhelms every other taste that there is. A meal at this restaurant apparently is intended to give one a strong and sure shove towards being an early diabetic. Nothing 'Perankan' at all about the cuisine! And it is terribly expensive to boot
3
We took our entire party out for a goodbye dinner here - recommended for those who hadn't been to Singapore before, so to some, a pleasant surprise...The building - as mentioned in other reviews - is authentically preserved and full of little nick nacks... The service is a little fussy for my taste, but they catered quickly for our extra portions - do Westerners eat more!?I ordered, but did expect more in the dishes for the price.I would say go, for a post-colonial experience, but pad your wallet and plan to pick up hawker food on the way home
3
The decor is superb with a lot of interesting artefacts. The waiters are very polite but not alert and attentive enough. The food is definitely overpriced: with S$42 for a set lunch with Longyan Tea (a Chinese fruit tea), one should get better than fried veggie, one piece of chicken braised in soya sauce, port meatball soup and glutinous rice as dessert. Most disappointing, they did not even have otak otak, a signature peranakan dish
5
One of the best Peranakan cuisine I had in Singapore is at True Blue Cuisine, a cosy little enclave next to the Peranakan Museum below Fort Canning Park. After a whole day of exploring Singapore, coming to a charming nyonya restaurant with the feeling of home-cooked meals complete with friendly nyonya aunties sharing their Peranakan heritage and culture through food is an experience to remember.Try the Keluak nut dish, superbly an acquired taste. The curry fish head is also amazingly delicious. It’s a place worth returning. Fair warning: while the food is beyond good, the bill will shake up quite an appetite on your wallet

We were there for a reunion dinner with a long lost friend from HK. A great evening out with friends was marred by appalling service and overpriced food. The portions were very small and costly as if there was rationing going on. Prawn crackers cost $4 per serving, rice was $3 a bowl and the waiter said we could not share the rice no matter what! My friends ordered 3 bowls of durian mesh dessert and they tasted bits of sugar in it. When we told the waiter (he was supposed to be the restaurant manager) about it, he gave us an irritated look and took the bowl away. He came back shortly, pushed the bowl back to us and curtly pronounced : "the chef said it is cook this way". The unspoken text was :"take it or leave it!" And to top it all off, they switched off the lights promptly at 9:30pm before the guests left the restaurant. We felt like we were being chased out. Imagine if you had brought overseas guests there! If this place was meant to be a showcase of Peranakan culture, it has failed. The Peranakan décor of the house-like restaurant is a great attraction amongst tourists but there's no homely feel about this place once you step in. My review and many others on this page have reiterated that the service and portions need improving. I really hope they do something about it because it is not just a restaurant but a showcase of an unique culture of Singapore
4
if you want to try the unique Peranakan Cuisine which is not readily available in Singapore , in an really nice old world setting in a 100 year old building wiht preserved artefacts of that time, AND are willing to pay rather top dollar for the experience- then this is the place to go to 
4
Unique Peranakan food!  True Blue is in a great old (100 year old) building.  It has an old Singapore feel.  Very friendly staff, great food, and a bit spicey.  Make sure to ask the staff when ordering.  They do a great job sterring you to the best dishes.  Worth coming back!Tip: ask the staff about the history and decorations and furnature.  They all are part of what old Singapore is about.

As a Westerner turned Singaporean since the 50's and "aunties' and friends mother's educating me in this authentic Straits cuisine I think I possess some credentials to write on it. Located in a "pre-war" building in Armenian Street the restaurant has the right decor and setting for this culinary experience....Greeted by a young staff, and a delightful elderly Nonya waitress called Maria, I leave the ordering to my host who is also knowledgeable in Peranakan cooking, With 5 dishes on order we start with a Longan tea that dark and flavoursome.The veg dishes were traditional kangkong blachan and "chap chye " ( mixed veg for "family togetherness ") but the servings were really sparing side plate sized for 5 people ( gosh a spoonful maybe for each ??) ....at $15/- a true blue price tag .... the chap chye lacked the entire veg combination in traditional chap chye...couldnt see the dried bean curd strips, tahu or vermicelli and there was a abundance of cabbage...kang kong lacked the important shrimp flavour base but was fortunately only light on oil.The traditional "buah keluak "chicken was not up to scratch in flavour ..just lacked that spice. This black nut seed dish needs to be soaked for three days to remove toxins but the pasty like meat in the shell has a very strong and medicinal like flavour and is a taste that requires inculcation. With 5 of these seeds and 4 chicken pieces I found the $45/- price tag almost doubly expensive than any other Peranakan eatery in Singapore. ( I seriously would give this chef a run for his fare !!!! challenge ?The rendang , an all time favourite was nowhere compared to several Indonesian eateries here and at $35/- for two pieces , WOW ...complete rip-off.....just didnt have sufficient cumin and chilli ...The best dish I would say is the sliced fish in Assam gravy which resembles Penang laksa broth....the right blend of heat, and tanginess...you could just drink it !!!With a tag of $300/- for the meal ( $2/- for a tiny saucer of blachan ) it has to be the most expensive and very average Peranakan I have ever tasted. The culminating let down was when 9.30 pm arrived and the Manager came over and told us the "restaurant is closed" in other words " piss off"....what a slap !!!He did the same with a table of 15 next to us without whom the place would have been practically empty......but for Maria ...who constantly came over to seek approval of the food and delight us with her young days in Katong, it would have been a disappointing evening but for the great company of my close friends and an excellent Amarone that my host kindly provided!!!!!.......

Let the chef decide. Mouth-wateringly good food here, in a chic cottage style. Their take on the Singapore Sling, served shot-style in a mini teapot was fun. Lovely dinner; will return!
5
Superb experience enjoying peranakan dishes. Coming from Spain, this was a completely unexpected dinner with tastes and flavours previously unknown for me. Highly recommendable.
2
I was honestly embarrassed after taking a guest here - was discouraged to dine at the establishment as it was close to 9 pm, when the restaurant takes their last orders, and then served cold fish. Not returning. Pity, because the ambience was great.
1
My wife and I took an American guest who requested for "local" food experience. The impression on entering the foyer was promising, but went downhill all the way, in food and service! when seated, the head waiter spoke to my guest, and virtually disregarded me, and was way over "helpful". The first 2 dishes arrived within 5 mins of ordering. All the portions were embarrassingly small. The food were mediocre at best. I can accept paying higher prices given the location and ambience, but the whole experience made me feel ripped off. If the owner is targeting only foreign visitors, it may work, but locals like me will not go back. Good luck to you
5
From start to finish, this restaurant was excellent. I was with 5 other people and we ordered family style, so I was able to taste numerous dishes. The most noteworthy were the fish head curry and the beef rendang. The service was attentive and warm and made us feel like guests in their home. The atmosphere is another great attribute to this place. Expect to pay for this experience, but I think the high prices were justified and I would strongly recommend this place
5
Our waiter spent time with us to suggest the best menu choices! Lunch was a little more expensive than expected, but was well worth the cost. Next to the Peranakan Museum (which we wished we had time to visit) and within walking distance of the National Museum of Singapore
3
Peranakan food is a perfection of the ethnic mix of Singapore. Elements of Chinese, Malay and India. True Blue is a wonderful space filled with the decorative arts of the Peranakan. The food is very good. It is slightly let down by a lack of finesse in the service staff and seems too expensive for what you get. You are even charged for iced tap water. I would go by 7pm and order the blacknut chicken, satay, shrimp crackers, rabbit rendang (or beef if they don't have rabbit) and anything else that grabs your fancy. Wonderful tastes. If the prices were lower I imagine this place would be full all the time and require a reservation
5
This is one of my favorite meals while in Singapore. It is located in a lovely old shop house, and the decor is very traditional. Both times I have visited, my friends and I have put our hands in the wait staff to make suggestions for what to order. The result was two wonderful Peranakan meals. A special suggestion is the traditional chicken cooked with black nut. It has a wonderful, spicy flavor, and the chicken is cooked to perfection. Another must-have is the salad with banana flower. This is a delightful dining experience
4
My husband and I had only one night in Singapore. We wanted to try Peranakan food. Blue Ginger was full; our hotel concierge recommended True Blue. Our host appeared to be the owner or at least an owner. He recommended our food and it was great, if a little unusual (but we weren't looking for usual.) At his recommendation, we had the jelly fish salad -- yee sang -- (raw jelly fish in pomelo, apparently not on the menu and only served for Chinese New Year), the ayan buah keluak (chicken stew with keluak nuts), "craw fish", which were actually small lobsters and sweet potato leaves, with a nice bottle of crisp slightly "spritzy" Portuguese white wine. The portions were not small and the bill seemed reasonable (I was worried when they brought out the craw fish, i.e. lobsters, but I need not have been). The only expensive item was the wine, which is expensive all over Southeast Asia. The price of this bottle didn't offend us given the cost of wine generally in the area. The lady playing the piano in a side room, and the museum next door (closed when we were there, but we got a peek), were a nice added touch. We were not rushed through our dinner. Our experience was very fine
5
True Blue is more than just is restaurant it is a cultural and historical experience. Located in the historic Peranakan (Mix of Malay and Chinese cultures) section of Singapore, the location is charming and the food is great. The service was very attentive. The food can be very spicy, our server asked how spicy we like our food. Went for a group business dinner with ten people. The restaurant is a little small, so I would advise getting reservations.Highly recommend it for both the ambiance and food
4
Family restaurant with typical Peranakan cuisine, a mix of Chinese and Malaysian food. Lovely people
5
What better way to immerse in Perankan culture after a morning visit to the Peranakan Museum rigth next door (my rating as the interesting museum in Singapore). Decor amazing. Pomelo juice very refreshing with prawn crackers. Signature dishes of chicken with black nut, prawns with curry leaves, deep-fried pomfret with tangy-spicy sambal sauce. Great friendly staff including owner's mom. Reserve your table before visiting the museum to avoid disappointment

I was told that this restaurant is better than Blue Ginger, where I have eaten several times - and the TA reviews seem to support that. All I can say is that I was disappointed. We arrived at 7.30pm to a near empty restaurant (they close at 9.30 and we were asked to order dessert at 9, something I had not anticipated!), so the ambience was limited despite the Peranakan surroundings; we were then hovered over by an zealous maitre d', who was hot on the hard-sell. Before we knew it tea had been poured (extra - and it was so sweet as to be undrinkable so we sent it back); shrimp crackers delivered for an extra $1 pp. We were persuaded, however, to take the jelly fish salad -Yu Sheng, a Chinese New Year speciality which you toss in the air for good luck before eating - for 4 ($32 - every dish had its cost pointed out - obviously they have been reading their TA reviews where others have carped on the hidden extras). In fact it was the best dish we had. The chicken with black nut speciality was tangy and tasty - but we had to pay for an extra portion to make 4 chicken pieces, as we did for the tamarind shrimp, which was over sweet and sticky and not very nice, and tepid. As for the rendang - I make better myself! We had a decent bottle of Australian Shiraz, averagely priced for Singapore. But at well over $200 for the four of us, with the small portions (rice extra too!) we felt rather ripped off, despite the nice surroundings. I will definitely go back to Blue Ginger where the portions and food are more decent
5
As was explained to me by a local resident this was quintessential Singaporean cuisine. I believe he described it as Peranakan. I can honestly say it had some flavors and spice combinations I had not tried before. But all were yummy. And the banana flower salad... I could have eaten nothing but that. It is a cozy restaurant with a neighborhood feel. The food was good, I think the prices reasonable. We ate family tapas style trying a number of different dishes among the four of us. I think that was the way to do it to get the most out of the experience. The dishes do tend to of a size suited for tapas dining. I would definitely recommend this. Although you might want to avoid the durian dessert. A bit of an acquired taste to say the least
3
Made a reservation for 8:30pm , party of 4 on Saturday pm. The service was prompt with good recommendations. But small portions and really felt rushed. By 9:10pm we were informed we needed to order our dessert. One server was continually " hovering" over us and pouring tea into our teacups as soon as we"d take a sip to two. Perhaps by drinking lots of tea we would not focus on the small potions!When we declined dessert, they then started to turn down lights in the area we were seated and were actively cleaning around us. The ambience was wonderful but felt uncomfortable in continuing our conversation. As we got up to leave, our questions related to history of place, food, etc was poorly met. Portions small for the price paid,Would recommend a much earlier seating

First things first: I am a Singaporean with a Peranakan grandmother. I have eaten my fair share of good home cook peranakan dishes, and also those in Singapore, Malacca and Penang restaurants.My dinner at True Blue last night has to be THE most overpriced, mediocre peranakan meal that I have ever had. Imagine the Bakwan Kepiting soup came in a small bowl with just 2 small meat balls (smaller than golf balls) for SG$10. Beef rendang costed $20 for 3 bite size pieces. Every thing seemed to be served in small tapas portions for entrÃ©e prices. Maybe the exhorbitant prices would be justified if the food tasted fantastic but alas they were mediocre at best. I get more satisfaction eating at my favourite Nasi Padang stall if I wanted something spicy.To be fair, the ambience was quite nice (though cramped) as the restaurant is located in an old Straits building and decorated in the Peranakan theme. Service was good too.My advice is that if you want to experience the peranakan culture and ambience, go to the Peranakan museum next door and then for your meal, find another better Peranakan eatery or just go to one of the many good nasi padang (if you only want spicy food like rendang) stalls or restaurants in Singapore.I am definitely not going back to True Blue again

We stumbled upon this place while looking for another place. This Peranakan restaurant serves food with menu very similar to our Indonesian dishes. However, with its Chinese presentation, the taste is so unique and wonderful that it lingered in our minds for a long time. Some of our group agreed that it was a very memorable meal. We had the asam chicken rendang kluwak, jantung pisang, and they had flavors almost Thailand food like. Some of the people in our group ordered the pre set menu, which was also filling with bottomless rice and dessert. The only down side to this restaurant is that it was pricy, at almost $90 per person there wasn't any special dish/ingredient we ordered at all.
5
Lovely little place, from the lady tucked away playing piano to the gift of a tea pot and cup when I left after their own take on the singapore slingLovely meal, asked for recommendations for what was the speciality and we were given a lovely selection of things I had never tried before - special plac
5
Never had this type of cuisine and was recommended by the concierge if we wanted to eat local. We asked for recommendations and it was one of the best meals of my life. For those who complain about price haven't been to Singapore, which is ridiculous in price. This was one of the cheaper places we are.
5
This was a great recommendation by the concierge at The Fullerton Hotel. Peranakan food is a very interesting fusion and a must-taste in Singapore. A great contrast to the hawker markets. The decor is lovely and there was an older woman playing the piano at night. The waiter (who may have been the owner) suggested various menu items which were perfect. Don't miss the signature dish - Chicken with Black Nut - Ayam Buah Kelauk. Fantastic. A great experience. Others have said it is expensive - I don't agree. OK it's not hawker food but it is a special, proper restaurant in Singapore which is also a cultural experience. Such a nice, authentic change from some of the shallowness of other parts of Singapore
4
2nd visit to Perankan Museum and True Blue cuisine.
Mutiplicity of tastes and texture in these dishes - try the signature chicken and prepared local nut dish
Expensive but this is not a hawker food centre.
Enjoyable to see business people eating here.
5
An elegant restaurant in central Singapore with a wonderful Peranakan menu. The dishes are unusual, even for Singapore, which has unparalleled gastronomic quality and variety. The food was outstanding, the service was extremely good, and the atmosphere very enjoyable. A very special dining experience!
5
Came here for an impromptu business lunch and the restaurant was empty. The decor has an old world charm, as did the service. The peranakan food was delightful, some of the best I've eaten in Singapore and definitely better than Blue Ginger. The only downside was the price, $160 for 3 at lunch seems pricey, but in guess that's Singapore
4
Old world charm in an old world restaurant. True Blue Cuisine is a Nyonya/Peranakan restaurant. I grew up in Malaysia so my base for comparison for peranakan food is pretty wide. This is by far one of the best peranakan restaurants I've ever been fortunate to visit.There's an element of homely feel to the restaurants from the decor to the cooking style. Even the waitress, or perhaps she was the owner, was very entertaining and offered a variety of suggestions of what to sample.I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the food itself was pretty good, apart from its small portions
1
Even if the setting is nice, the quality of food is nothing to be exited about, just typical home cooking, you can get much better in Kuala Lumpur or Malacca.For 2 persons, just 4 dishes, no wine, I paid 146 S$, and the portions are so small it is embarrassing. I go to a restaurant to EAT, not to sample food. Must as well call it Peranakan tapas or snack. I was still hungry at the end and really quite disgusted about the price. You even have to pay for sambal belacan. Really shameful ! Please management, look into it, I have been around for 35 years and never came across such a rip off place..

Had a small business lunch, the food was amazing. Some dishes reminded me of my mum's cooking. THe decoration was quaint and homely, the display of blue and white pottery items added a nice touch. It was a bit confusing to find initially, walking in and out of the museum but well worth the effort. I understand the price was a bit on the high side though

Two of us shared a. Business dinner. The historic building is beautiful and a piano was playing in the background. The food was excellent. Small portions, so make sure to order a few dishes but the flavours are fantastic. The waiter gave us good advice on what to order. An interesting experience

We went to True Blue on the last night of Singapore Night Festival based on our guide to Singapore. Even though I could not say the food was bad, it came in ridiculously small portions for the price charged. The spicy pineapple prawns felt very lonely between the four of them. My set dinner menu with two main dishes easily fit into a portioned plate. All in all we paid 120 SGD for little, not terrific food and a somewhat nice setting. Appalling

Right next to the Peranakan Museum, it is ideally placed to put this culture in its culinary setting. The food, setting and decor were wonderful and staff were happy to explain aspects of all three. Although the food was delicious and distinctive, the portions were somewhat smaller than usual for Singapore and for the prices charged. However, I was seeking an experience, and got it
5
We enjoyed a very special meal here. Everything was very fresh & delicious. It is so lovely being among the antiques,and also really enjoyed the red date tea served. (They even let me buy some from them)Make sure you visit the little shop next door & the Peranakan Museum - amazing needlework examples & so much history

The staff were no existent, portions were small and was overpriced! Cashier system wasn't working and felt ripped off! Wouldn't go there again!

The concierge at Raffles made the reservation for us. We took a cab there and walked back to the hotel later.We were greeted at the door and shown to the only available table in the place. The food is Singapore cuisine. It was new to us so our host chose for us. Everything was delicious. One dish was chicken cooked in clay pot and flavored by special nut. After we enjoyed the dish we were given the menu that said the nut was poisonous until it was treated before the cooking process. We loved the hospitality, food, atmosphere and the piano music. We may have been the only tourists there that night

This restaurant was recommended in a booklet made by the Singapore Tourism Board. As a first timer to Singapore, I thus went there to have dinner with a friend on 5 May 2014. I don't know whether reservation was hard to make as my hotel made it for me. We arrived at about 6:30 pm that night, and there were only 1 or 2 tables of people dinning. The decorations are really beautiful and that's all. The staff was rather pushy. Whatever dishes we tried to order, he would just say "not available" and then "recommended" those "yummy" or famous dishes of the restaurant. We were baffled and suspected that they only prepared a few common dishes every day. If that's the case, why did they offer us the customers a menu? Everything we wanted to order was not available. This is ridiculous. We finally ordered 3 main dishes and 1 dessert recommended by the staff and we were stunned when they arrived (See the photos). Each dish cost SGD10 to 20 and what came up on our table were in extremely small portion. Each dish only got 3 small pieces of food. Say the spicy stewed beef, it's portion was only 3 small cubes. The beef was dry and hard to chew. I really couldn't believe stewed beef could be so dry. The dessert was also ridiculous. It's just sweet rice balls, and there were only 2 balls in a dish and cost about SGD8! When we ordered baby coconuts as drinks, the staff said "not available" again, and was pushy enough to sell us the fruit juice that had been prepared. All the 3 main dishes, 2 small portions of rice (very dry without much moisture), 1 dessert and 2 glasses of fruit juice cost over SGD100! I felt that I was really a stupid tourist to believe in the recommendations of the Singapore Tourist Board. If you have too much money and don't know where to spend, just go to this restaurant and enjoy the rip off experience

It's a pity for True Blue because they've got a lot of things right: first the food is awesome. Traditional Malaysian dishes, with a few surprisingly excellent dishes such as the "Chicken stew with black nuts" (an absolute must try!) or the "Banana flower salad". Flavours are rich and subtle, although it is true that portions are really small. The place itself is really cute, very "boutique" style, with lots of vintage photos and antic furniture. Unfortunately it's the service here, that is really awkward.As rightfully said by many other Travellers, the Boss is way over the top. Although probably friendly in nature, he is extremely bossy and rather stressful. First he wouldn't let us chose our dishes according to our own tastes, and tried to influence our entire order. While we were in a casual mood with my friends, we didn't really mind, but I believe this could be very uncomfortable when in a more formal set up or when with Customers. But what I really didn't like is the way he tried to rush us out of the restaurant: first he was obsessively refilling our (already full) wine glasses. The wine was a really nice bottle from Portugal that didn't come cheap, so it was really inappropriate to push us to drink it so fast. Even when we kindly ask him to slow it down, he would come back a minute after for refill. Second, he was way too present. Always standing next to us, watching on us and interrupting our discussions abruptly with nagging comments. It amused us, but again in a less casual mindset it would have been plain upsetting. Last, he really started to piss us off when he kept asking a countless times if "we needed taxi", arguing that the "Kitchen was going to close very soon". We felt rushed in a harsh way, and considering the relatively high prices for small portions, this was again not appropriate. Finally, the stubborn little man ordered the taxi anyway, and triumphantly came to say our taxi was "waiting at the door", while we still wanted to stay: our wine glasses were still full, some dishes un-finished and we were enjoying a nice discussion. I looked at the watch thinking it would probably be something like 11 PM, and guess what? It was...9.20 PM only! The final note was almost 300 SGD for 3 people, which is really expensive even in a city like Singapore.My best advice to the Manager would be that he takes a couple of deep breathes in before serving customers, and seriously considers adopting a more relaxed, respectful attitude. It doesn't feel nice for Customers to have to be stressed like this for ordering dishes, drinking wine and leaving the restaurant as fast as possible. We aren't just pigeons with wallets that come and drop some bucks. We come here to enjoy a whole experience, and quality of service is definitely part of it. With all the great dining options available in a city like Singapore, the food alone doesn't make the difference. The service and genuine care for customer is as important as the content of the plate.If you are not shy to go anyway (the food is really worth it), just don't hesitate to cut the man short before he "takes control", and straightforwardly let him know that you intend to choose your dishes by yourself and be left in peace for your meal. If I come back, that's exactly what I'll do.As a short word of closure, I would have happily put a 4/5 for the great food, but the service is just so far behind that I had to put a 3. I hope service can improve in the future, or be left in the capable hands of a more professional restaurant manager

We went as a big group but 3 were to arrive a bit later then we were threatened we may have to move and without any notice one waiter brought appetizer plates telling each price and kept urging us to order quickly. The manager kept complaining about a few coming later. While I was not told children were not allowed at reservation, after brining my 2 year’s old daughter it took them 30min to bring her juice so she got bored and wrote a few lines on the table cross with a ballpoint pen. Then the arrogant attitude waiter told us I had to pay 30$ for it and I refused. Later after coming home I realized they put ‘miscellaneous’ and did charge it in a bill. I know this place over 7 years and while food tastes good the portion is becoming smaller each time and price is way too high. They must think they are queen’s restaurant or something that no matter how bad their service is people still come back. Maybe it is true, that is why they can have such an arrogant service
2
Although it's a really funky Chinese shophouse, we paid $140 US for lunch for 3 people. The owner/server told us that he would order for us and we had 20 minutes to eat it! It was bizarre and although we enjoyed our quick taste of Peranakan food, portions were very small and certainly not worth the price we paid. After reading other reviews on this restaurant, I think it's obvious that there are problems with the service and the prices
1
Extremely poor service!Despite the decent taste, my girlfriend and I was served with ARROGANCE, TEMPER and TERRIBLE ATTITUDE.While my girlfriend was finishing her remaining dessert, we were requested by manager to switch table so they could accommodate a group of tourists. I refused by saying "It wouldn't be necessary since we are finishing in two , three minutes." He was obviously infuriated and screamed to the tourists, "YOU GUYS WILL HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY LEAVE!" while pointing to us with under-civilized manner.A restaurant with such reputation would be expected to provide customers with pleasant dinning environment; and be capable of resolving issues internally without triggering disturbance to any customers.If such fundamental expectations exceeds the capability of the True Blue Cuisine, please be polite, at least
3
They 'up sell by putting crackers , and tea at the tables when you are seated - $1 for 1 glass of water- replenishment is chargeable - they charge for the take out box. And if you are small eaters please make sure staff does not help you over order. I think they all have a average bill target and they 'll upsell

We ended up here as a recommendation from the concierge at the hotel. We had never had Peranakan food before. The waiter (Naz) gave us some recommendations including a chicken dish with black nuts. It was excellent. The three of us shared about 5 dishes and enjoyed each one. The flavors were so interesting and we walked away full and satisfied. It was a happy experience and we would definitely go there again when we return to Singapore

I've been to this restaurant for perhaps a dozen times over the last 5 years. It is a charming place with great ambience and a convenient combination with the Peranakan Museum when you have visitors. The food is good and well presented but it is hardly top level cuisine. What is attractive about this place is the setting which visitors infallibly appreciate. What is off-putting is the mean-minded was and arrogance of the owner(s). For example, despite spending a thousand dollars on meals, they will still charge you $2 when you ask for chilli sauce. This is just plainly bad business and bad PR. Also, service portions vary erratically. Though Peranakan food is always abundant and plentiful, this restaurant specialises in serving ultra small portions which seem to get smaller with fewer guests. And if you want to have extra serving cups for your Kueh Pieti - sorry, they will not be able to oblige. Generally, the quality of the food is fine but try asking for some variation - you will hit a brick wall. It is fine to stick to a recipe - this is every cook's prerogative but there are ways of delivering that message without conveying sheer arrogance. As for value for money - I can list half a dozen Peranakan restaurants that will serve the same fare for half the cost. So, the question is - why have I not stopped going there? As I've said, the building (a charming shophouse) is something worth looking at but since then, I've found another place - so, stay tuned. Another thing, they close at 9.30 and too bad if you are in the middle of dessert. You will be told to go. To the owners, this definitely ain't no Peranakan hospitality. And they are poor ambassadors for openness and friendliness of the Peranakan community.

A stunning meal. The black nut chicken and pomelo salad were a highlight. Not only was the food and Naz's hospitality fantastic, the restaurant itself was a cultural experience. Will return there on our next trip to Singapore.
5
Had a fantastic dinner here on my last night in Singapore. Naz, did a great job helping us navigate the menu and explaining the cuisine. The chicken with black nut was AMAZING - each dish was delicious, fragant and prepared perfectly. The space is very pretty and the pianist was an extra treat. We were recommended to go there by a Singaporean and she was bang on

I went to this restaurant a few years ago and was blown away by the quality of food and service. I recently went back with my wife and 2 children for an anniversary dinner and came away somewhat disappointed. The food was still a great example of modern peranakan cuisine,and the presentation was good-but the servings are ridiculously small for what they cost. The corkage for BYO is quite ridiculous given the limited wine list and the mark up on the wines available. It seemed to me to be a case of building a great name and reputation and then just forgetting why it got there in the first place-or even worse-just not caring about how it treats its patrons. It's an insult to be charged $25 for a dish where 4 people barely get a spoonful each .I used to recommend this place to friends visiting Singapore-but will stop doing so as there are far better value places to dine
4
Nice place, prompt and friendly service. But above all a very interesting food, prepared with care, flavours that you either have forgotten or never known.Of course if what you look for is pizza and cheesburger, but also Angus steak and foix gras, this is not the place for you. But if yiu are intested to savour, once in a while, delicate oriental flavours, It ca be a pleasant evening
3
Corkage fee was $50. Pot of tea placed on table was $28. Bill was already $78 before we even ordered rice ($3 per serving). Food is good, but portions are small. Total bill for 6 persons (women who do not eat much) was $350 - and we were still hungry. Kitchen closed on Saturday night at 9 pm. Staff pushed all diners out the door by 9:30 pm

I used to like this restaurant and I go there everytime I go to Singapore but service and food quality have started to go downhill in the last two years.Last week, I went there for dinner and made booking before I left the hotel. Got there around 8:50, not sure last order was 8:45 or 9:00, in any case, the hotel has asked them to try to accommodate when we were on our way their before 8:30. The first thing they told us when we arrived was that they were closing at 9:30 which we knew already. I went there before, it wouldn't take long for the food to arrive especially there were only 2 tables there which were already eating. We just wanted to have a quick dinner but you could tell they wanted you to go so that they didn't have to work overtime. I told them this is not the way you should treat customer espeically they came all the way and there was still time before they closed. They kept telling us it's their policy. Even big chain restaurants in Hong Kong or the rest of the world wouldn't throw this to their customers' face. I recalled that it was the same when I went there in Jan earlier this year. Whether the objective of opening a restaurant is to solely make money or wanting to bring good food to people hoping they will return, in most cases, I think should be both, this restaurant is doomed to failure.Unsurprisingly, when I talked to other people I met in Singapore, they experienced the same bad service before. So why would you go there when there are plenty of peranakan restaurants out there unless you want to feel unwelcome
4
I dined here with some friends on August 12 for Dinner and had some dishes new to me and some very familiar, the food was of good quality and very tasty. The setting and decor of the restaurant is stunning and very comfortable with friendly staff who try hard

I went with a group of twelve, one of whom has a Singaporean background and ordered for us. First tip: the kitchen closes at 9pm and the restaurant wouldn't accept a reservation later than 7.30. The surroundings are fascinating. The meal? Well... The reviews about price and size of portions are bang on. We had a selection of the recommended items and the best part was trying a type of cuisine I hadn't even heard of before. Even with some of everything plus rice there was plenty of white space on my plate. I had a small beer as well, and a small portion of uninspiring mango purÃ©e. My bill was $88. The whole meal was about the size of a generous appetizer in North America.Mr Naz looked unhappy. There was no warm welcome (unlike the warmth I have received everywhere in Singapore). At exactly 9pm the lights were switched off at a servery next to our table! We were asked to pay cash as the restaurant didn't want to pay credit card commissions. Finally they agreed to a maximum of six credit cards. In the end only one person who didn't have enough cash used a credit card, but the others felt they were cleaned out of cash. We asked Mr Naz to order taxis for us, and several times he came out and told us not to accept a passing taxi as the restaurant would have to pay if we left. Anyone would think they were operating on a shoestring - hardly the case at those prices! I'm glad I had the experience of the environment, the type of cuisine, and the company of international colleagues, but I am still in sticker shock and wouldn't go again or recommend it to others

If you eat anywhere in Singapore this restaurant is a must. Nonya food is a sublime mix of Chinese and Malaysian cuisine and the menu items are exquisite. Recommendations are the shredded turnip, black nut and satay just to start. You must have the True Blue Sling, a wonderful drink with gin, rose syrup, lemongrass and lime. you are served the drink in a mini tea cups from a teapot. The owner provides wonderful service and will recommend dishes on request. The food is not cheap but you will leave feeling you have got value for money and a dining experience to remember
1
Can't believe they still charge for every little thing - water, keropok, sambal. On top of that, portions are tiny, menu expensive and staff nothing less than absolutely rude. It's amazing how they manage to survive with all these bad reviews. Hopefully someday soon they will close down and let a decent restaurant take their place on beautiful Armenian street.
1
This was the worst experience we had in Singapore. The food was awful and the service was terrible. The manager was rude and unhelpful and rather ungracious to an old friend of ours at the restaurant. I would avoid.
2
Opted for the set lunch menu....$28++ per person. Nice soup, but the main course had the smallest piece of chicken imaginable and it had bone in....so about 3 small bites in all. Hardly any vegetable either. Plain rice and an ok gravy but they were in separate compartments and difficult to combine, and that was it! We asked for plain water to drink, and unlike in most Singapore restaurants we were charged (though it was then "free flow"!) We asked for chilli and again we were told it was chargeable. The dessert was smaller than a matchbox. Overall...$35 each and we were done in 30 minutes flat. And I was still hungry.It has an interesting ambience, but the money grubbing attitudes and small portions left a bad taste
5
This is our first trip to Singapore and we wanted a memorable evening with local cuisine. True Blue delivered!! We have never had Peranakan food before but were willing to give it a try. The black nut chicken is a signature dish and was very different and delicious. We also had the prawns in tamarind sauce which was delicious as well. This was complimented with a banana flower salad -- have you ever had these dishes before? Since we do not know the cuisine, we relied on our waiter, Nas, to suggest the menu and we were not disappointed. The flavors were spicy but with depth of flavor. And it was very different from what we would have in the states. This was all set in a very comfortable environment. The restaurant is an old, restored shop house with antique furniture. We would recommend this restaurant to any of our friends. The evening is one to remember
2
Restaurant in a restored Chinese Malay house ( Peranakan). The set menu food was extremely bad, served in a cafeteria style dived plate and the proprietor was rude after we complained she did not recommend it even though its prominently listed on page one of the menu. Outside the set menu the food was good. Expensive and not good value. The waiters although nice were unprofessional and just dumped rice on our plates 15 mins before the food came out. Would not recommend this place.
1
The ambience is nice, but it's a real tourist trap. The waiter, Naz, was ontop of us the whole meal...super aggressive and irritating. He made sure we gave his tip to him outside of the restaurant, so he would not have to share with the other wait staff. The food was good but very overpriced. A meal for four cost $250. Come on, and this was lunch. Your better of going to a hawker stall and paying $20 for the same meal, only better and without the aggressive wait staff.
4
This restaurant has the ambience to go with the food. As non-locals we did find the experience wonderful. The food was delicious, the staff gracious and the venue, the restored shop house with all the antique furniture and fittings, the perfect complement to the food.We were recommended the chicken with black nuts - a signature dish - and it was amazing, as were our seafood selections and dessert - too much it turned out - eyes being bigger then stomachs.We did not find the cost prohibitive, nor the staff unkind. There was a good crowd inside which made for a lively, noisy atmosphere, convivial and welcoming.Recommended for anyone who wishes to experience the food and a great venue together

True Blue is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that celebrates the indigenous Peranakan cuisine. Over the last 20 years Singapore seems to have forgotten its own food traditions while embracing cuisine from almost every region from the rest of the world. True Blue serves Singapore food as I remember it from the 1980s. The restaurant is located in a traditional Chinese house and authentically decorated with antiques. The service was very personal with the waiter helping me make my selection which I must say was superb. It was on the expensive side but then you expect that in Singapore. I paid about AUD50 for 3 courses but it was value. To get the whole Peranakan experience, go to the museum first. It's next door and then have a meal at True Blue

I am singaporean and I stay in singapore. I usually use tripadvisor for my travels and not for reviewing restaurants in singapore. However, after today's dining experience, I feel compelled to write a review on True Blue to warn diners, especially foreign guests, not to be ripped off at True Blue.The food portions were pathetic. The beef rendang had 3 small pieces of beef. They charge their "special prawn curry" $15 each. The regular Assam prawns ($20) also only had 3 prawns. If you want to serve hilariously small portions of food, you might as well charge by individual portions but I guess they didn't want to plate up each portion.They charge per portion for additional condiments - $4 for keropok, $1.50 for sambal balachan. They charge for water unless you order a drink.What pissed us off totally was they wanted to charge $2 to take away the food we couldn't finish. That was unacceptable. We would not have wanted to take away the half portion chicken and otak and ngoh hiang but given the ridiculous price charged, the unfinished food was worth at least $20.This is pure profiteering for True Blue. It is highly distasteful how they try to be a fine dining restaurant but concurently want to charge for items like water and take away containers. The food and ambiance were not bad but totally not worth the price.Please give True Blue a miss and go to other places like Blue Ginger (in tanjong pagar), Kim Choo's (in Joo Chiat, eastern part of singapore), PeraMakan (Keppel club or east coast) or immigrants (tapas bar in Joo Chiat)

This is a very unusual Chinese restaurant for most people. It has existed for many years but it is very appropriate that it has moved to Armenian Street, next door to the new excellent Peranakan Museum. The Peranakans are the descendants of the Chinese (and not only) that arrived in the Malayan peninsula in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, escaping tyranny, war and hunger and married the locals, a mix between Chinese, Malay and Indian which blended cultures, religion and of course the cuisine.I strongly recommend that you visit the museum first and then come to the restaurant: it will make everything a lot clearer.The ambiance and decor is fenomenal in rich Peranakan style. You get the feeling that you are in a 1920s family front room.The food is exceptional. You will find it difficult to recognise any plates in the menu but let yourself be advised by the very young and extremely competent waiter and you won't go wrong. The food is Peranakan based but with some modern and fusion licences. So that you will understand, we spent two weeks in KL, Penang and Singapore and this was the best meal we had. I think that is some compliment.Do try the sweet potato greens, the beef rendang cooked in coconut, the wonderful Kerabu Jantong Pisang or the prawns with curry leaves. absolutely wonderful.The place is not cheap (â‚¬50 per person) but then, apart from some food courts, nothing is cheap in Singapore. Let's face it: for the price of an average european restaurant you are getting top class.A must if you are in Singapore
4
There is a family feel to the food here with a warm feel of the decor. Although some portions are small, the chicken buah keluak makes it all worthwhile. Those dining should know that nyonya cuisine has always been about lotsa dishes shared on the table and this food is the real thing- my nyonya partner thinks so. As It is in a handy location next to the excellent museum in Armenian Street one shouldnt expect coffee shop prices ,so its worth it for the yummy flavour blends of Tru Blue
2
Nice ambiente, but the food doesn't live up to that. It was very blunt and lacking quality. The chicken with Buah Keluak was stringy and also the other dishes were rather mediocre. Would not go again.
4
This is a tough review to write. On the one hand, the restaurant really feels magical. It's decorated beautifully, with Peranakan ceramics and lanterns and whatnot. Smells like heaven. Really feels special when you walk in. This was my first time eating Peranakan, though I live in Singapore and have dined "family style" many times. The ordering situation was a bit complicated. We each tried to order something, but the waiter really wouldn't let us finish our sentences, and kept commenting on things. For example, my mother in law wanted fried chicken, because she doesn't like spicy, and he tried to stop us saying it was bland. We also ended up with more food than we could handle, based on his recommendations. The food was good, but I agree--small portions that were too expensive. And nothing really blew my socks off, though I will admit the food definitely has its own personality, and its nice. I probably won't go back, unless we have friends in town that want their first Peranakan experience. It definitely feels grand and authentic. But it's overpriced and confusing. I won't be putting it on my regular rotation
2
Pros: the restaurant is exquisitely decorated with Peranakan antiques and photos. Staff uniform were in the traditional sarong kebaya with men in batik print shirts. Cons: prices were ridiculously sky high for the quality of food and the portions were so small they would look small even on a side dish. For example we ordered 2 portions of "banana blossom salad". It came in a narrow white dish measuring 7 x 3 inches - that contained 2 portions of a salad and cost S$32 (+ 10% service charge and 7% GST on top!! ). What 's worsecwascthatbthere was no evidence of banana blossom (itself an inexpensive ingredient anyway?) and the sauce tasted like a prawn cocktail sauce. Quite shocking. They also charge S$3 per tiny cup of sweet tea, S$6 per tiny plate of achar pickled vegetables that barely fitted into a 2 inch soya sauce dish ( that we thought was amuse bouche from the house - wrong!!!), S$2 per portion of rice per person. So even before we started the meal between the 6 of us we had paid S$5 each of hidden "cover charge". And if you ask for sambal chilli that's another S$1.50, thank you very much.Recommended dish: chicken buah keluak. You can get as good or better for the rest of the dishes AND at half the price.I am all for supporting the growth of nonya cuisine and restaurants but the pricing of this restaurant is totally out of order. And service .... What service? We had to wave our hand to get any attention. For 6 of us with 3 beers only, we paid S$320 without desserts or coffee
1
The ambience is very nice, located inside a refurbished Peranakan shophouse next to the Peranakan museum. However, as a local, I think the food is a tad overpriced and the portions tiny! My aunt and I do not eat a lot of carbohydrates so we normally share rice servings at meals. At this restaurant, we were told that we were not allowed to share the rice. Secondly, we asked for some sambal belachan, a common condiment (like chili sauce) at a Peranakan or local Sinagporean restaurant, The server was happy to oblige and brough us two saucers with a dollop of the sauce on each but neglected to tell us that we would be charged for the sambal belachan. We only found out about it when we called for the bill and saw that we had been charged S$3 for the two saucers of sauce. There are other Peranakan restaurants with similar ambience and quality of food. I do not think that I will return here if I can help it
3
My 4th trip here - I highly recommend the beed rendang - very spicy, and the chicken with black nuts - very typical and an unusual but good flavour. Not cheap, and portions quite small, but always very friendly service in a 'home style' dining room. Next door to thefantastic peranaken museum
5
This place is a bit expensive by Singapore standards but it is well worth it to try Peranakan food which, lets face it, you are not going to get in many other places in the world. Some of the dishes are unique and quite delicious. The staff are very helpful with recommendations and the service is efficient.
4
We wanted to take a guest to a Peranakan cuisine restaurant so booked True Blue despite some of the unfavourable reviews elsewhere on the internet. We were immediately pleasantly surprised - the restaurant is in a charming shophouse, the staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming and they continued to be helpful and attentive throughout the meal. The food is also excellent - particularly the beef randang, the pomelo salad and the chicken buah keluak - but the portions are very small. Most Chinese restaurants serve over generous family style portions - these were barely enough for the three of us. At the high prices True Blue charges they really need to increase the size of the portions - as well as the wine pours
5
This little restaurant oozes charm and tradition! The food is amazing. A little pricey for Singapore? Sure, but if you are after a unique and traditional dining experience you can't do much better.The little extra touches of care and pride make this a very special gem!!
5
We had a group dinner at this restaurant and what a wonderful set of taste sensations! From spicy salads with edible orchids to creamy beef rendang and tantalizing squid rings. Everything was presented in a lovely fashion and each dish added something new to your palate.The service was excellent -- very subtle but always there when you need them.If you enjoy the fusion of Chinese, Malay and Indonesian kitchens you're going to love going to True Blue Cuisine
5
I dare say this is the best Peranakan cuisine I have ever tasted, in Singapore, in Penang, even in Melacca. Each dish was meticulously prepared, full of flavors. The food spoke for itself. For the 4 of us, we had the longan red date tea (great for the spicy food to come!), crispy prawn crackers (my toddler son loves it!), squid in sweet black sauce, ayam buah keluah, okra in candlenut sauce, big shrimps in sambal sauce and ended the meal with cendols. My father-in-law commented that the sambal sauce tasted just like what he had in the 70s! Authentic! My mother-in-law, a nonya and picky eater, also commended on the various dishes. Each of us had way too many servings of white rice to mop up every last bit of the gravy! Good job, Chef Ben! Only dish that fell short of the standard was the cendol. Not enough gula melaka (the last round I went there for lunch, the cendol had TOO much gula mekala. Too sweet). It was a little disappointing. My son had the minced pork balls in clear soup. He unfortunately didn't like that. Service was not great, just ok. With all the tables full at dinner time, the restaurant was severely understaffed. I love how the restaurant was decorated. Just like a luxurious Peranakan mansion. Great food and authentic decor came at a big price tag. It costs close to SGD 50/ pax

Portions were small but tasty. Quite a pricy place but since the food is good, I would def. return. Liked it.

This small restaurant serves typical local cuisine that is a mix of chinese and malay. Luckily I was taken to this restaurant by my singaporean colleagues who knew exactly what to order and made sure I tried all the specialities - a great evening.

This restaurant is a must try! Stop after a trip to the Peranakan Museum for some of the best food we have ever eaten. We can easily get Thai, Chinese or Indian food in the US, but not Peranakan!

This is a unique dining experience - but it is fairly highly priced. I dined fairly modestly with one other, and it came to $75 per head. It's worth making the effort to go there, but expect to pay at least that amount.First timers should definitely try the Black Nut Chicken - scraping out the grated black nut from inside the shell is good fun and worth the effort. Also the banana flower salad is wonderful. We tried the spicy crayfish - a relatively small amount of actual crayfish, but beautifully presented and very spicy.The only disappointment was the mixed vegetables - mostly cabbage prepared quite blandly.The sweet tea is a lovely accompaniment, and our cups were filled as soon as we emptied them. If you're looking for a uniquely Singaporean experience, and prepared to pay, then this is the place to go

Didn't honour AMEX 1-for-1 offer- Very rude staff, bad customer service, small serving sizes! Won't visit ever again.Prior to my visit to True Blue on 2 July, I emailed them on 7 June to make my reservation in advance. In my email, I had enquired about whether the AMEX '1 for 1 set dinner' was still available - and they said it was. So when we arrived at the restaurant, they presented us with their menu. The first page had the True Blue Set Dinner. So with the AMEX offer in mind, we decided to order the True Blue Set Dinner (which came with soup, 2 dishes, rice, dessert for $38++/person). Portions were REALLY small, so between us 4, we had to order another appetiser, main dish & dessert to share! When it came time to settle the bill, it came to over $200!! What a shock! The staff at True Blue refused to honour the AMEX offer, which if you check the AMEX Selects website says '1-for-1 set lunch & dinner' - which is exactly what we ordered! The True Blue staff said to get the offer we had to order the special 'AMEX set dinner'. However, when we were placing our order, there was no mention by any of the staff of the existence of such a set. If such a special set existed, they should have either let me know:1) in their email reply to me when I enquired about the AMEX offer2) in their menu (normally restaurants with special AMEX menus/offers, place a 1-liner saying something like - 'for special AMEX deals, pls contact our wait staff for further information')3) by actually telling me about the special AMEX dinner set when I ordered (since they knew I already enquired about it). There were so many opportunities for True Blue to tell me about the existence of the special AMEX set! But it was only upon bill time, that they told us. And supposingly, we also have to order the special AMEX set in advance - but there is no mention of this on either the True Blue website or the AMEX site. All that it says is 'Advance reservation is recommended' - which is exactly what I did when I booked the table 1 month ahead!! To add further insult, when we were arguing about the bill, one of the waiters we were talking to, just turned his back to us and ran away!! There was no 'excuse me' or anything. How rude is that????? And when we confronted him about his behaviour, he didn't apologise or say sorry. He just said 'OK'.I definitely won't be visiting True Blue ever again, and will recommend to friends to visit other Peranakan restaurants in SG instead

This is the place to go to if you are into fine Peranakan food, surrounded by Peranakan decor and pieces, and are prepared to pay.I was here for dinner on a weekday. The bill for this party of 6 came to S$450 or about S$75 per pax. We had fishhead curry, fried squid, chicken in black nut, meat ball soup, fried prawn cake, beef rendang, kueh paitee, white rice and 2 types of desserts. For drinks, we had pomelo juice. We were offered prawns at S$22 per piece but declined to take it up.The food was generally good and not too spicy. The flavours stood out. The dishes were served on decorative Peranakan ceramic dishes and bowls.The service was efficient but came across as rather rushed. All the food came within a space of 5 to 10 minutes, which kept us wondering if they had been pre-cooked. After we emptied our plates, the waiters removed them rather quickly. The pace ought to have been more relaxed, as after all, it was a weekday evening and not as if there was a queue at the restaurant.The waitresses are decked out in shapely traditional Peranakan wear. There are lots of Peranakan pieces on display and the entire restaurant was done up to make you feel like you were in a Peranakan home.On the whole, it was a positive though pricey experience. Definitely suitable for those who want an authentic Peranakan experience

I just moved to Singapore and friends recommended this restaurant for authentic Peranakan food. I was very surprised at the variety of the menu and the tasty dishes we were served. The chicken in blak nuts sauce was definitively something I had not tried before, very tasty!The service, although not super excellent, was quite Ok and we enjoyed all the dishes and the decor - it's based at an old house which is refreshing to see in Singapore where they usually demolish all old buildings.As other reviews have noted, it's not cheap, but if you don't over-do it with the alcohol, it's quite ok! I personally don't drink alcohol , so did not find it expensive.Worth the visit

We first went to True Blue in their old location and have visited the fancier Armenian Street establishment a few times, usually when splurging with out-of-town guests. The decor is quite nice and feels like old Melacca and the menu has a good selection of dishes. The Ayam Buah Keluak is pretty good and I love the ice kechang topped with fresh Durian when it's available. My only complaint about True Blue is that they are always trying to push guests to spend more money (e.g., on tea, side dishes, etc.) so bear this in mind or you could end up spending $70/person when you don't need to in order to get authentic Perankan food in Singapore

We tried the Ayam Buah Kulua - the black shell nuts with Chicken. Beef Ren Daang - curry beef and the drink was Chendoll - the coconutmilkshake. Food was exotic and interesting. The staff was wearing Batik, Sarong Kebayas. Service was good - typical Asian politeness

This restaurant was recommended by a friend in the US. It's good, be careful if you don't go with a local. You can easily spend a lot of money on dinner. They have a set menu that is 38$ but once your waiter arrives, watch out. A 50$ prawn is not unusual, and in my opinion not worth it. We really enjoyed the sweet potato greens with curry. Not on the menu. It was a fun experience. We did get pimped (successfully} for a tip, which is not standard, and probably WAY MORE than deserved. still a fun experience

We read the reviews, so were forewarned- beautiful surroundings/decor/ambience. The food was great too. The service however left a lot to be desired and spoiled what could have been a lovely night out. We had read the reviews on line, and they were too true. No sooner had we sat down when we were presented with tea, prawn crackers, and spring rolls - we asked if this was complimentary and were told that that this was going to be charged for- so we declined. We read about the pay for one get 2 deal with Amex and asked if this was on offer and were told that it was and decided to order this as we were not that hungry. Our meal appeared immediately afterwards- before we had time to order wine - Wines quite expensive $25 corkage per bottle, $50 for champagne. Wine by the glass: $13.00 + tax.Service was super fast and rushed- no time to relax and take in the surrounds. our questions re the menu/ food were not answered or they were not interested in answering.I wanted to know what the flavouring of the agar jelly was, [a chinese New Year special] and was told that it took 3 days to prepare and was not something they would divulge!All in all- lovely place, delicious food spoiled by indifferent service/attitud

beautiful building, one course was ok, the second was inedible. We asked to pay and firstly no comment was made about the uneaten plate and then the bill had plenty of unpleasant surprises which added 50% - prawn crackers, tea, rice, sweet pastries, all perfectly pleasant but not asked for and which turned out to be expensive. On asking about this the manager said he had told us about the cost, which is a lie, and then turned aggressive. Avoid

Have been to True Blue on a few occasions, on weeknights to take out of town guests to try Peranakan food. It’s a good choice if you want your guests to try Peranakan food in a central location – I usually combine it with a tour of Raffles Hotel, or drinks/live music at Timbre nearby. After both experiences, I can’t help but feel the food is over-priced for what you get, both portion-size and quality. It’s good, but it’s not great. And I've experienced a few odd service moments. It’s a fun experience to try different dishes, and the highlight is when the gentleman who must be the owner or manager comes over to explain the dishes and offer insight into Peranakan traditions. If you come on an off-night when it’s not very crowded, you are keenly aware of the fact you’re one of the only tables.The food is fine, though if you’ve had homemade Peranakan food, this doesn’t quite compare. On our first visit, we LOVED the prawns with curry leaves, but then strangely the price jumped to $15/prawn. If you go, try the Ayam Buah Keluak (a signature Peranakan dish with chicken pieces stewed with buah keluak (black nut) gravy. Great spice, flavor unlike anything we’ve had, though don’t expect much chicken.We did have one major service gaffe on most recent visit. We had ordered a few beers and “ice water” (because it’s completely safe and acceptable to drink restaurant tap water in Singapore), and the waiter responded, “Still or sparkling?” to which we replied, “Ice water is fine.” He made a face and exclamation, "Ooh, ah..." like, "do you really want to do THAT?” I find this rude in general, but it was especially comical at a casual eatery like this place and in Singapore, where it's very common to drink tap water. I suspect the manager noticed this as he seemed to made a point to keep an eye on our table, chat with us, and we saw little of the awkward server after that. During another visit, with a group of four, we had ordered a second bottle of wine only to receive the oddest look of disbelief from the server, not sure why. She went away (presumably to bring the wine), but instead a manager came over about 20 minutes later to say we can't have a second bottle of wine "because we're closing in 30 minutes." We were perplexed as, 1) four people can easily drink a bottle of wine in 30 minutes, and, 2) we had ordered the bottle 20 minutes earlier, which would have allowed more than ample time. Hopefully these are oddities

What a lovely building in the old style with air well, antiques and curios! The food lived up to the decor. It was not a cuisine we were very familiar with but the waiter was very helpful and suggested some dishes. All were delicious. It was plain that much care went into the preparation of the rempah base as all of the dishes were rich and well balanced. I wish I could tell you the names of the dishes we enjoyed so much but the only one I can remember is Ayam Buah Keluak which was chicken with black nuts - absolutely superb! One note - wine was not the thing to drink with this food. Beer is much more compatible with the spicing! We would certainly have returned had we not found it so late in our holiday.

We went here for dinner upon the recommendation of the concierge at the Raffles Hotel, who also made us a reservation. We asked the hostess to suggest some dishes that were typical of the area. She recommended several items on the menu and every one was outstanding. I can not remember everything that we ate but it was all delicious. I do remember that we had sauteed sweet potato leaves that were heavenly and tasted like sauteed spinach. We suggest that you ask the hostess to make some suggestions based on what is in season and then sit back, relax, and enjoy your meal!The restaurant itself also has a very interesting atmosphere with a lot of local decorations, some of which were historic in nature. There is also a small fish pond in the back of the restaurant

I visit this restaurant rather often but this recent visit over the weekend will be my last.- the restaurant was filled with a crowdy and noisy tour group! 3 tables! that's a true sign that a restaurant was going down hill. and desperate for business.- the quality of the food and drinks have suffered. e.g. the red dates tea is so diluted that it tastes like "longkang chui" (drain water!)- they nickle and dime you for everything!!! $1 for tap water, $2 per box to take home food that you can't finish, extra $ for chilli, etc, etc. - the service is inattentive and poor.overall, poor value for the high prices that they charge

I took my family there for a birthday lunch as I had eaten at the Katong branch in the past and thought it was good. The ambience was great, but that was it. We were very disappointed in the food - the banana flower salad had hardly any banana flower (it was all cucumber, and banana flower is not even an expensive ingredient), there was no gula melaka available, the sotong was too sweet, the crab meatball soup had hardly any crab. It was thoroughly disappointing. Perhaps tourists or people who haven't eaten peranakan food won't know any better but if you want to charge these sorts of prices, you need to serve better food as there is a lot of competition in Singapore. I don't mind paying well for a good meal, and do so often, but never again at True Blue

Disclaimer: My hosts footed the bill so I cannot comment on the value for money aspect as was alleged by several local reviewers.I was taken here by some friends/colleagues for lunch whilst I was on a conference trip to Singapore.The atmosphere is very cozy with antiques all over the place. Not very crowded and we were seated immediately.Service was pretty fast and the tea was very good. Had the chicken with betel nut as well as the rendang and sausage and all were very flavorful. I am a fan of spicy cooking and this place had just the right amount of heat and flavor in its food.Would consider returning to this place in a future visi

I went there yesterday evening. The floor manager chose the food for me (some spicy chicken and a banana flowers salad) and it was perfect! Then, he was really kind with me, explaining the origin of Peranakan cuisine, che ingredients, and he also gave me a present and a book!I went alone but I never felt alone! And the food was delicious

We very taken to True Blue by a local Family. We had not eaten Nyonya Food before. Our hosts ordered for us. The beef ( a curry ) was very tasty, the chicken with a local nut collected from Indonesia while black was full of flavour.The salads ordered were fresh and full of flavour . the best i thought was the Prawns with Bannana shoots .The local desserts pineapple tarts we sweet & caramelly at the same time. There own tea blend finished the evening out very well. There is a wine list however I did not see it., did not see the bill either . A must try for to taste of a new cuisin

Its a good fine-dining restuarant whereby even the old aunties and uncles will like. :)

Recent visit to True Blue was utterly delightful-- an oasis of calm and culinary delight in the midst of busy bright Singapore. Check out the wonderful Penakian (sp?) museum next door, with its current display of beautiful Singapore costume. We started with a fabulous salad that had a hint of grapefruit, a hint of cilantro, cooling and crunchy and slightly sweet and sour. Pressed duck was also amazing and so was the signature red tea. Waiter made brilliant suggestions. Yes, the dessert portions could be a bit larger--otherwise this place is perfect. I will be back

This restaurant was recommended as serving the best Peranakan food in Singapore, in a lovely traditional setting. It is situated in a quiet corner of busy Singapore and it looked pretty harmless enough, with a nice décor, but very low-key. At the entrance we were asked if we had a reservation, even if most tables were empty and then admitted in. I found this attitude a bit annoying.However, the worst part was the tea and crackers served without asking us, which were then charged at exorbitant price. We ordered bottle of wine and some non-descriptive food, which may be the “best” Peranakan food, but then made me understand why I never heard of Peranakan cuisine before. It is because it is not worth of any mention in the history of cuisine.Since it was our wedding anniversary, we informed the staff, who proceeded to create a “special” dessert for us. Sadly, this turned out to be only a few slices of fresh fruit set on ice. Needless to add, they were also overpriced. As a way to ease the pain of the outrageous check, we were offered a couple of glasses and a book to take away as a special present… and as a souvenir of never, ever coming back to this fraud of a restaurant

This has to be the best Peranakan food in Singapore. The Ayam Buah Keluak is the best I have ever tasted.. The banana flower and cucumber salad is so unusual.. and always finish with the Durian and Tapioca dessert. We take all our overseas visitors here to taste real Peranakan food, not to mention see the Peranakan antiques..

I have seen many comments on the chef/owner, Benjamin Seck's, rude and arrogant ways. I completely agree with previous comments on him. He was aggressive and rude when talking to diners.We had quite a lot of leftovers and wanted to take it home to avoid food wastage. The waiters had cleared the dishes and brought it to the kitchen to pack. Ten minutes later, another waiter returns and informs us there is a charge to pack up our leftovers. This was the first time we were informed of their restaurant's "unique policy to discourage diners to take food home with them". They wanted to charge $2 per container, regardless of the size of the container. As they had already begun packing the food, they were willing to "do us a favour" by not charging us for one of the small sauce container which they had already filled. When dealing with this situation, Benjamin condescendingly informed us that if we were not happy with this arrangement, he would unpack the food from the container and re-arrange it back onto the plates for us to decide how we would like to deal with the food. Thanks, but no thanks..!Regardless of the quality, quantity, or price of the food, the dining experience was most definitely ruined by the foul attitude of this chef/owner. If anything, he will be the sole reason for their downfall.We will never return to this restaurant, will never advise any of our friends to dine at his establishments

This is truly a place that will leave you blue! Food is truly pricey and way overpriced. Didnt order rice but was charged as my hubby put a small spoonful of rice (about size of 50 cent coin) on my plate. Didnt even touch the rice at all. There were so many service staff who stood around our table & witnessed it. The evidence was in my plate that the tiny spoonful of rice wasnt even touched. When bill came, asked the staff why 2 plates of rice were charged, she said it was because they saw rice on my plate. This is ridiculous as the service staff were standing around watching us. The boss, Benjamin Seck didnt even have the guts to explain & reason with us even though he was around. Avoid this place at all costs. It is a tourist trap. Prices are way overpriced & place is not customer friendly

They do not ask if you want crackers or tea, but serve you these items as if complimentary and then charge you for them without telling you. And they are not cheap! Most restaurants of any caliber just simply provide customers with these items without charge. True Blue charges for any and everything they can!!! The prices are on the high side for all items... even a small serving of rice will cost you! We were surprised we were not charged for the chairs and tables and use of cutlery, etc. Honestly, to us, any establishment that charges its guests without any notice is acting like any common criminal thief as it is truly the same as stealing/pickpocketing! Shame on this place for stealing from its patrons!Oh, and the interior decor is no big deal, the service is mediocre and the food is not top quality. In fact, I would bet my life that most items are made early in the day and not at the time of being ordered. And of course, they did not have everything that was on the menu! Do not waste your money here. Over-priced, mediocre service and food. What a shame

We chanced upon this restaurant whilst browsing through one of the free issue local guides that I tend to disregard (it wasn't listed in the Lonely Planet guide that we regularly use). Having not eaten traditional Peranakan food before we weren't sure quite what to expect or even order but after being put at ease by the the very friendly waiting staff and listened to their recommendations we set about ordering a selection of dishes. As per many South East Asian cuisines the courses all arrive in one go and we soon had a table full of food! All of the recommendations proved to be superb and the highlights were the Banana Flower Salad, the Prawns with Curry Leaves and the Chicken Stewed with Nuts.The atmosphere/ambience combind with the genuine friendliness of the waiting staff make you feel that you're eating in their own homes and I would certainly go back again (given the opportunity)
5
No, it's not cheap. However the decor is only out-done by the authenticity and quality of the peranakan food and also advice re what to order. I saw the chef on one of the food channels talking about the food but didn't 'click' until i was leaving. A must for anyone who loves quality, authencity and class. As an indicator (not for snob value) the table behind us had several high judges having lunch and over from us a table of surgeons - all regulars. If you visit Singapore and love food then pleeease go here

The location is 49 Armenian Street near National Museum and SMU. The listed tripadvisor location is old.Certainly one of the best restaurants in Singapore. If you want the best of Nonya/Peranakan cuisine, this is the place. The food is perfect with exquisite spicesJust some very good choices.Pisang Jantong (banana flower salad) A+Ayam Buah Keluak (Bettel nut with chicken)Ngonh Hiang (Prawn and chicken mince rolls)Beef RendangOtak Otak (fish paste in banana leaf)Take the red date tea they offer you, it's very tasty and goes well to digest the food. Locals argue it's expensive for home cook cuisine, but these dishes are done exactly right with very nice ingredients. The service is friendly and attentive. the restaurant is part museum with many antiques and located in an old shophouse. They charge you for everything they put on your table, but just go with the flow and consider it part of the package and culinary experience.Will return, and do recommend
