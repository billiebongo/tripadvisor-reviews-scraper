From the sushi to the wagyu beef.... flawless
It’s a small restaurant and it’s actually more fun to sit by the sushi counter and see the chefs cook live.
It’s definitely not a cheap place to dine but then it’s Singapore!!!!

By far the best Japanese food ever!! Quality of food and service was extraordinary. Thank you to all the Chefs who took care of us and Shirley who knew what we exactly wanted on the menu.

Last evening, 4 of us with a room to ourselves and we expected to have an excellent meal. With 3 glasses of beer and the bill turned up to $2100/- that is more than $500/- per pax. The quality of food was so so, the dishes were nothing outstanding. Itâ€™s a daylight robbery, and I would ask all to be very watchful. Not recommended at all

Nested in the ground floor of the Goodwood Hotel in Scott Rd. Tatsuya is differing from the famous Tetsuya in Sydney ( and now in Singapore too) for only one letter. And at to my modest opinion is serving an even better japanese cuisine. Nigiri, Sashimi, Maki, Usuzukuri using stellar ingredients and prepared either in a very traditional way or, at your leisure, in a contemporary arrangement. A magistral use of the "Aburi Technique" is adding something special to the best Omakase you can have in Singapore. The price is staying on the high end of the rank but quality, attention and skill of the Sushi Men brigade is largely compensating the money issue.

Visited this restaurant a few days ago. It is very well located at the ground floor of the impressive Goodwood Park Hotel in central Singapore (22 Scotts Road). The setting is very nice with an elongated sushi bar, as well as an area with tables. Everything that was served was very fresh, tasty and elegantly presented. Both sushi and grilled fish (mackerel) were of high quality and the service very good. An excellent place to dine

Don't step into this restaurant if you are not prepared to spend a lot of money for food. The lowest price set lunch was $32++ and and the higher price ones can run into a few hundreds dollars. The restaurant is not very big. A long sushi bar counter plus a small room with only 3 tables. Alfresco dinning is available but not conducive for the hot Singapore weather.Service was excellent. I ordered the sushi set which costs $100 ++. An appetiser and a small dessert were included. What can I say about the sushi - it was so good. Literally melt in the mouth. I wish I can go there more often but the price is a big deterrent

For sure this restaurant is classy, the sushi are very good , nothing you will kill for but good, service is absolutely perfect , most of the sushi chef are Japanese this is good! Prices are super high , I suppose you pay for the perfect service, perfect sushi bar (hyper clean) and for the locatio

We regularly visit this Japanese restaurant at least 6 times a year for more than 10 years. It's consistently good in terms of the quality of the food and never once has the food disappoint; however, the service staff can be a hit or miss at times. If budgets a constraint; then it's best to avoid, as it's not cheap. You will get better value in Japan or Taiwan. This weekend there was a promotional set. I had the $150++ set lunch; & have posted the yummy main dish. Alan LeongSingapore

This is simply the best Japanese food in Singapore served fresh. Although it is a little pricy, it is worth every cent. Sit at the bar and let the chefs serve you with the freshest seafood and mouthwatering treats you have never experienced before. They place great attention to detail and are always experimenting to Come up with New tastes and textures.. ask for Goh San or Sasaki San.

This is the place to go - a reasonably new Japanese restaurant which is located along the right hand wall to the entrance of the Goodwood Park Hotel's main entrance (if it is raining - ask theTaxi Driver to drop you off at the door). Mr. Sasaki Kazuyuki is the Senior Sushi Chef and it is amazing the variety that is made right in front of you if you are seated at the Sushi Bar - for the less venturous there are also wonderful bento boxes to be had -open 12.00 for lunch not sure of time for dinner - would suggest a bookin

It's my first visit here with great expectations and the food did not disappoint. Over here it's quality over quantity in choices. Be prepared to spend an average of $140 per pax. Total damages were $420+ after 10% credit card disc.
5
not a cheap meal but totally worth every penny. The location is lovely, the staff is super friendly and helpful and the food is really realy yummy.
5
We had a fantastic night recently at Tatsuya and will definitely be going back. Seats at the Sushi counter, while a little awkward for a couple, were great as we got to see all our food being prepared.

Disappointed with the capital D. The foods was ok but not at the price they charged. Service was below par. Had to wait for a while to the soup to be served.

I lived in Japan for many years and love Japanese food. The food here was ok but extremely pricey. The service was a real let down. No Japanese waiter/waitress in sight and it showed. Certainly not what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant at a 5 star hotel

I come here when I have a craving for a luxe aburi chirashi don. It's expensive but it's so flavorful!Other special dishes (of the same flavorful vein as the aburi chirashi don) are: seared prawn sushi wrapped in tiny omelette w special sauce n caviar, wagyu don (omi), scallop w foie gras sushi, special maki ($60), hokkaido ice cream bruleeAll very pricey but totally worth it for their umami bomb and great taste.I've only ever been here for lunch and always sit at the counter. It's very noisy as I believe they do alot of takeout orders. So it's kinda against the whole luxe concept. But no matter. I'm just here for the food

My husband saw many good reviews for Tatsuya , but I wasn't impressed with some irregular shaped sushi roll pics posted by some diners . Anyhow , we need to find out just how good is good and which league is Tatsuya in so we decided to try it out for lunch .Was seated at the bar counter . Wanted to order the omakase but decided to save it for dinner if the lunch proves to be good . They have cheaper lunch sets from $30-50 but we ordered the aburi lunch sets at $90per set. ( although I am not a fan of aburi when it come to sushi but apparently TAtsuya is famous for this) Observations while at bar counter :1) selection of fresh seafood is limited , mostly are the common and inexpensive stuff like salmon / sword fish , hamachi , surf clam and a piece of toro.2) parts of the bar counter is made of laminate and not the solid beech wood which is deemed one of the key and sacred elements for a reputable sushi restaurant . Some of the counter areas has some black patches that looked like moulds. It is sad as this counter is highly associated with a sushi chef's pride and honour. 3) the sushi chef frequently place plates and cans /bottles items on his chopping board while using the same board to cut their sashimi for guests ! Unbelievably for a sushi restaurant that charges up to $350 for its omakase. I would forgive this act if it is a restaurant that charges $20 for a meal. Really shocked ..4) You can tell if a chef is professional by the knives he used and how he takes care of his knife . For a sushi chef, this is his sacred tool. Chef here tossed his knives haphazardly in a corner after using them to cut the sashimi , dumps them in the sink and scrubs it vigorously with a scotch pad like some cheap knives .. not trying to be a snob , this is just not pro ...5) We ordered our lunch around 2pm, and half way thru the meal at 230 pm, the sushi counter was cleared and turn into a washing area .. everyone was frantically cleaning and scrubbing the entire length of bar counter ... soap /foam / Pails/ bleach are all at display on the counter . They seemed oblivious that there are still guests at the sushi counter trying to have their lunch peacefully . We are forced to watch the entire cleaning exercise while having our lunches .. Nobody really bothers .. they just talked loudly amongst themselves , discussing the cleaning process and what to clean next . Bleached was poured into a big pail filling with water from the tap right in front of us while we tried to swallow our aburi amidst the strong smell of bleach and occasional splashing of water over the counter that closely missed our aburi.5) The Aburi - each piece of sushi ( was was intensively torched with two canister ejecting flames simultaneously ... the result ... fish cooked almost to the core ... not exactly the skilled way to create the slightly oily but soft and tender aburi sushi .. Side dishes - nothing worth mentioning . Verdict This sushi restaurant does not have much passion/respect with regards to its ingredients , its. sushi counter , it's knives and it's guests. Food hygiene is even in doubt .Thus , our conclusion is that Tatsuya is miles away from being the best sushi restaurant in Singapore ... please read all the good reviews with a pinch of salt ..It is nowhere near the top end sushi league of Shinji , hashida and kimura sushi . it is probably just slightly better than those neighborhood or chain restaurants . Don't waste your money on its omakase , go somewhere for some authentic and genuine sushi experience for this price. This place has no passion in every aspects. We won't be back for sure

I am not so sure. I ate here almost daily during my visit to Singapore, and I liked and loved so many things about it. The reason I hesitate to recommend it, is certainly because it is expensive, and I didn't have dinner in a Japanese restaurant of similar category to compare it with in Singapore. I also ate very simply, I did not have the set menus, so my food was not indicative of what others were eating. You certainly do not have to spend what some other reviewers had mentioned, our dinners on average were around $100 per person with one drink. However, venture into set menus and drinks, and you may feast and pay for it as well. So I would qualify my recommendation of this restaurant, absolutely go if you are not concerned about prices, or if you want to order from their a la carte menu and don't get carried away with off the menu items. The chefs are fantastic, the food is great, the service is excellent. Do I remember the prices or do I remember the food? actually I remember the food

My hubby and I initially booked Hide Yamamoto at MBS for the evening but we felt that it was too long a drive and it may also be a chore to find parking on a Saturday night. Hence, we decided to ring Tatsuya to see if they would be able to accommodate us. Surprise, surprise they had two counter seats available. This was unusual as we literally rang up at noon for dinner at 7:30pm. This would be our third time here. Raw food is not really my cup of tea and a o my husband went for the sushi portion for one which was $120. It came with 9 pieces of sushi (3 aburi and 6 raw) along with a miso soup and appetizer. I ordered half of the special makimoto and the cold noodles with tempura. We then ordered another half makimoto along with 2 wagyu beef aburi. We also had a cold 250ml sake to wash down the dinner along with green tea and Sapporo beer. For dessert, we had the Hokkaido caramel ice cream.Overall, the dinner was very pleasant and the food was undeniably good. Some years ago, we came by and had the full Monty of chef's omakase but that was way too much food. The bill was under $400 and we only realised later that we were accorded with a 10% discount on the bill - my husband didn't manage to ask as he did not notice it when paying the bill. It could be a credit card promotion but we are still not sure. I will definitely come back as the food is good but for the pricing, it would have to be for a treat or a very special occasion :-

Having previously lived in Japan for an extended period I have very high standards and a refined palate for sushi and Japanese cuisine generally. It takes a lot to impress me however Tatsuya did it. Delightfully subtly yet professional service ensures that the food is what dominates the experience. While omakase (chef's selection/degustation) is not my preferred meal style this is the place to do it, however the elegance of their sushi selection (and agedashi tofu of course) is very hard to beat. The wine list is very good but the sake selection is divine. I think it could be the best Japanese I've had outside of Japan. The only warning is that you need to have a real passion for Japanese cuisine and genuinely value extraordinarily produce to cope with the bill. It can be an expensive evening.

We enjoyed an Omakase menu by one of the expert sushi chefs. He let us choose our favorites and tailored the experience. We'll be back again!

Delicious & fresh sushi. I like to sit at the sushi bar. I especially like their tuna roll and Japanese pickles. They also offer take away which is a plus.

We went to Tatsuya after reading the good reviews. I will agree with most of reviewers. Food was good but service was rushed. But we also felt discriminated. My Husband and I were seated at the bar thinking it's more fun to watch the chefs at work . But it was not fun at all!The Chef was giving special treatment to the couple next to us. Maybe they were regulars or they give fat tips and deserved special treatment. This was fine but the Chef completely ignored us the whole time. It's quite awkward as the Chef was only talking and focusing on the couple. Serving them special dishes one after another. I have no issues that regulars get special treatment. But to be totally ignored when we were seated just next to the couple at the bar the entire evening was bad form and insensitive
2
It is quite good for a Japanese restaurant in Singapore. But is Tetsuya worth the price? Absolutely ... Not. For what it's worth, the quality of the food is what you will get a modest neighborhood restaurant in most of Japan. For the price you are paying at Tetsuya you should get at least a one star value, but as I mentioned, it is both far from satisfactory in terms of taste.You'd better off heading to Suntec City and having your Japanese fix there for 1/4 the price.I would not recommend this place.

Feb 2017. Had Dinner. Ordered Omakase. Total Bill S$1,300+ for 3 pax.We have in the past dined at this restaurant several times but sadly this will be our very last visit.Most of the staff from the chef to the waitresses, gave us the impression that they want to finish serving our dinner as fast as possible.We initially thought there were 3 seatings that night because they were rushing us through our dinner. But at about 9:30pm when we finished, we noticed that there was not a single soul queuing outside the restaurant.They were rushing to finish serving all the dishes as soon as they could. I saw there were salad even sashimi prepared way before they were being taken away to be served. The whole experience was as if we were part of a very efficient production line. The chef prepared the food very quickly, the waitress served them at lighting speed and we have to swallow the food very fast. There were a few instances as we were finishing our food the waitress was already standing next to us waiting to serve us the next course. It was as if she was trying to tell us "hurry up, why haven't you finished?" thus pressuring us to quickly gobble down our food. The only dish we have to wait was our beef.The whole night we felt that the staff was trying to finished their work as fast as they could maybe so that they can go home early. We felt so rushed and we were not comfortable at all.This place is a total ripped off now. We felt there isn't any passion at all in their cooking. Every course tasted very mediocre. Even cheap and simple Itacho provides much better service and cooks better food then them. Not sure what Tatsuya uses in their cooking because we felt very thirsty and needed to drink lots of water after this dinner.Well, I have totally regretted my decision to dine here instead of elsewhere as suggested by other members of the family. Never again will we be back.To be honest the best food of the night was the birthday cake which was ordered from the deli at Goodwood Park Hotel

If you like your Japanese food delicious, authentic and fresh, this is the place to go. I had the sashimi bento and simply adored it. The wasabi was very delicious. The sashimi is simply stunning to eat. The tamago was sweet and supple. Everything is just nice at an affordable price of just $45++ per set. A high recommendation

My wife and I visited Tatsuya Japanese Restaurant at Goodwood Park Hotel yesterday for lunch to celebrate my birthday. It was our 2nd time there in a month. Advanced booking is recommended. You can choose to sit at the sushi bar or at a private table in a cozy dining area. We arrived around 1pm and noticed that the sushi bar counter was fully occupied.In this restaurant, you are guaranteed authentic Japanese food. All ingredients are freshly imported fromTsukiji wholesale market. The service is prompt and swiftly executed. I was impressed that the lady serving us remembered us and even what we ordered previously.If you are planning to eat here, be prepared to splash. The food is not cheap. But the food is fresh, tasty and prepared with a lot of passion. You are not paying for the food, you are paying for the whole experience.For starters, we ordered their avocado salad (served with a dressing made from rice wine and sesame oil and other ingredients), and nimono (a rich vegetable stew with shredded chicken). Our main meal was the shashimi unajyu (eel) set. The cawanmushi that came with the set was smooth and the best I ever tasted. We also tried the aradaki daikon dish (consisting the head of the amberjack fish with Japanese radish and soup stock). The fish was fresh and fleshy and went superbly well with the radish. All, in all it was an excellent experience. If there was one improvement that I could suggest is that the menu should also provide the names and include the description of the various dishes in English. It would then save everyone some time asking the staff to explain them to us. A great restaurant, great ambience, great experience

Over the past years, my palate for Japanese food has always been bias towards Tatsuya.They may not serve the traditional omakase, they do however serve very fresh and well made dishes in the course.Notably their aburi sushi are almost always constantly Good, but do take note that they use vinegar in most of their sushi and hence the taste is more flavourful thus by which i mean non traditional. For those who wants to taste the natural freshness of the food then just inform the chef. They are always friendly and I always felt like I'm home during my visits there.Their weekday lunch are also quite reasonably priced and a good power lunch there with bento sets are always good value for money for excellent Japanese food.Chef Goh San always remembers what I prefer and notices what I don't like so he will prepare something else for me. A truly personal experience while it can be pricey this is a fine dinning Japanese restaurant which I feel is worth every cent

Always wanted to try Tatsuya after watching it shown on AFC Best thing I ever ate. Went there for lunch, and tried the Aburi sushi set. Ingredients used were very fresh. Really good quality caviar was served. However, I did not get any interactions from the sushi chef (I was seated at the counter). Service was above average but not the best. Overall, very good quality sushi, although not the best I had
5
Wow - what a dinner !Such a amazing Japanese dinner - great night , fantastic atmosphere - sooooo good. The chefs went from very good to better to amazing . I will for sure come back - and anyone who looks for the best of Sushi - don't look further - this is the place in Singapor
5
Pricey but worth it. Spent $600 on dinner for a couple.
The sushi and sashimi was fresh as it comes. Prepared amazingly well! Art work on a plate with friendly service. Definitely a one of a kind Japanese restaurant!!
5
This restaurant serves the finest quality of Japanese food with the ingredients imported from Tsukiji Market in Japan. Ask for the Aburi Chirashi when you dine here! It is pricey but worth indulging on! Love it so much!
5
So my husband and I wanted a nice chilled out evening and we decided to go to Tatsuya for some exotic sushis... The head sushi chef was serving us that night.... What a place... Totally awesome... 😊👌
5
Great atmosphere. Outstanding food. The preparation and the presentation were top notch.
Very expensive, but worth it.
5
Fine dining. Nice good. Please try Aburi Sushi or Aburi sashimi Tuna belly Soup. That visit was the 5th time . Now whenever we visit Singapore, We will have at least kne dinner in that Japanese restaurant . Recommended.

The quality of food is not bad but I did not quite like the ambience. Firstly, I can't stand the loud unsoothing music being played throughout dinner. Secondly there is now where to place my handbag other than their cupboard. Even though it's a night out with my husband, I need to be contactable just in case the children need me...I had my phone on the table the whole time round. Looking around I realized everyone has their phone on the table next to them. Thirdly, I've tried so many Omakase restaurants, Tatsuya made me feel "cheated". I saw the photos posted in trip advisor and realized I was served similar kind of sushi, sashimi to customers months back... I mean I thought Omakase means serving the freshest seasonal catch imported from Japan. And the Uni served was the size of my pinky fingernail on top of a piece of sushi! I spent $1600 and I think I'm better off at sushi ichi!! Too bad they were fully booked for the night! Lastly, the place was noisy, uncomfortable and overcrowded. Felt a little like communal dinning... All the chefs looked like they are in an assembly line..
5
Read quite lots of great reviews before coming here and truly the reviews are proven to be true, in terms of the fresh ingredients and the great flavor of dishes served by the chefs.Went here for lunch as they have set lunch menus which is quite bargain for the wallet. Yet we also ordered many other items from the a la carte such as sashimi (ootoro), rolls, oyster and sushi. All the ingredients are so fresh you can immediately tell. Best seats would be at the bar, cause you then will be able to see the chefs in action, preparing the orders with great skill, which is a good attraction itself. Weekend is usually a busy period, so prior reservation is a must otherwise even waiting is notpossible since the capacity isn't much.
5
One of the best omakase experiences in Singapore, and each chef brings a different flair and style to their dishes. It is quite pricey (approx. SGD 500/person), but worth every penny. Dietary restrictions are always taken into consideration and their service is top notch. Lunch deals are extremely value-for-money
5
We visited tatsuya based on the recommendation of a friend and loved it. The sushi chef was amazingly talented and the fish was very fresh. We got the lunch omakase which was 200 singapore dollars per peson but it was definitely worth it. If you love sushi and have the money to spend, dont miss this place
5
The food was fresh, delicious and extremely good. I loved the place! The service was incredibly hospitable and as vegetarians, we found the guided us well. The food! By far the best Japanese food in Singapore. It was fresh, of amazing quality and really well served. The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant is also great. If your visiting or looking for a nice place to eat with the family, Tatsuya is the place!!
3
Frankly a very ordinary experience for the price we paid. In their moderate defence, I'm comparing to restaurants in Tokyo and London. This was not a patch on them. The wagyu was extremely poor while some of the sushi and sashimi were nice. I would not go here in Singapore where there are an array of amazing restaurants
5
This is by far the best sushi experience I have had in my life. The fish was so fresh, service was amazing, and you get to see the sushi masters in action right in front of your eyes. Highly recommended if you like traditional Japanese cuisine. No brainer

My wife surprised me with dinner at Tatsuya ! She had had lunch here before and wanted to bring me for dinner. We sat at a table but realised that it's more fun to sit at the counter and watch the food preparation . Staff are friendly and our host explained the menu and specials. We told her we wanted to try a selection of sushi and sashimi and left her to request the Chef to prepare the items. The sashimi was very fresh - fish is flown is from Tsujiki market - and it's better without soya sauce. Our sushi was done aburi style , and had very interesting toppings - like caviar , truffle sauce , radish etc..We also tried the wagyu beef slices which proved to be tender and very tasty.For dessert the Hokkaido caramel ice cream is a must - actually one serving may not be enough ! Overall a lovely fine dining Japanese experience which would have been nicer if we sat at the counter. I have to thank my wife for bringing me here. Good place for special dinner occasions given the expensive pricing . Lunch has less expensive options but food just as good and fresh .
5
Had a fantastic meal at Tatsuya! By far the best sushi in Singapore. The flavours are delicate and the food is prepared with a lot of love and presented beautifully. It was a lovely experience. Real perfection :) The ginger tofu was divine and they prepared a special avocado, asparagus green salad for us with a sesame dressing which was also really nice. The sushi was out of the world and the tempura was light and satiating. Highly recommend Tatsuya
5
I'm usually quite apprehensive where raw seafood is concerned but was reassured by the very first morsel presented. So fresh you could smell the ocean! We let the chef decide the courses. From various servings of sashimi, sushi, soup and rolls, all extremely well prepared and tasty. Only complaint was the seats at the counter were blasted with cold air and we had to ask the wait staff to turn down the air conditioner. I can get a bit noisy with the chefs, wait staff and customers all chatting away at the same time. Another minus was the 1 unisex toilet which was outside the restaurant which meant a long wait made uncomfortable if you had to go urgently!!Overall the experience was very positive, the food divine, with a price to match!!
5
Tatsuya is an expensive, high-end Japanese restaurant in the Goodwood Park Hotel near Orchard MRT. Set price dinners approach $300 per person, however at lunchtime you can pick up a sushi / sashimi bento or a chirashi set for around $45. The quality of the fish is outstanding and the restaurant is nice. Service is friendly but on both occasions I have visited they were very busy. Book ahead
4
We ended out omakase meal with a delicious jelly and tomato with plum wine. What a delightful end to the meal. Before the desert, we were served some rock melon and strawberries. Divine ! My only disappointment was the beef. I would rather it came without the sauce so that we can savour the taste. Pricey but not many good restaurants of that caliber in Singapore
5
In anticipation of the impending non-stop fattening process these coming days, my wife and I started our first full day in Singapore by skipping breakfast. Rather, we head over to nearby 'Cold Storage' supermarket on Somerset 131 and bought some fruits to munch on instead.At noon, we were picked up by my wife's cousin at our hotel and drove to nearby 'Tatsuya', one of Singapore's finer Japanese restaurant in the Goodwood Hotel for a sumptuous Omakase lunch. Since the head chef Sasaki - san knows both my wife's cousin and in person, very special personal attention and service by the chef himself was given to our group. This is a norm amongst most Japanese restaurants around the world, particularly in Japan..The tasting menu comprises of a never-ending array of appetizers, salads, prIstine fresh Sashimi, Sushis ( both regular Edo Nigiri and Aburi style ), soups...etc. Just when we thought we had enough and were full to the hilt, the chef presented us with a bowl of Wagyu A5 beef rice! Are you kidding me?Overall, the food was refined, delicious, containing some pretty exotic and high-end ingredients and artfully plated. From the counter display, one could see the varied and huge selection of pristine fresh fish and seafood, most of which were flown to the island directly from Japan.Man! After this first sumptuous meal, we felt like a couple of geese on a Foie Gras forced fed trail! My first thought was that, I need to have my liver check for stiffness and fattiness when I get back to Hong Kong! Ha!
3
Allocated to be seated at sushi making table. I can tell you all the gossip between the chief during our dinner as they talk to each other during making sushi, no hold back and is so unprofessional talking in front of your customers. Staffs was loud talking and running around like the headless chock. We have to ask 3 times to get our bill so we can leave.Foods was good but the noise killed the night
5
My wife and I dine at Tatsuya 2-3x each month. Excellent quality food with great service and personable chefs. We normally eat at the sushi counter. Our favourite items are aburi beef sushi (melts in your mouth), california handrolls, and our sashimi bento sets (served during lunches only - excluding public holidays). Tatsuya has private rooms, and also outdoor seating. We always book beforehand as it's a popular place. We often see regulars at the restaurant, so it clearly has a loyal following. I can't recommend this place highly enough
4
One of Japanese institution in Singapore, been coming here for many times. Most of the times is for the good set-lunch. Come and try for yourself
4
I would call it average, but its just not fair as the quality is very good. It would be more appropriate to simply call this place overpriced - and in my opinion just not worth the exorbitant prices they charge.
5
They close at 11pm and take last orders at 10:30 so ignore what google map says for now April 2016.The restaurant is parallel to scotts road so if you're walking from orchard road turn in to wards the hotel - Goodwood Hotel and carry on walking to the left side of the building.When even the wasabi paste is not left to waste then you know this place is no joke. They serve real wasabi from the root.Yes the price is slightly high but you also get your fish's worth. And you can watch them at work if you get a table at the bar. 2 coke cost S$7 and 10 salmon sushi cost S$60. Not that much for a special occasion in a lovely setting.Staff apart from the chefs wear kimonos and the bright rooms are cold so take your jumper. Or you can sit outside if you rather be in the singaporean warmth

My friend know that I really love Japanese sushi and very particular about it. When I visited her last month, she brought me here. Because the usual place she went was closed on Sunday.The sushi was okay only. But the aburi sushi was very, very good.. I would really recommend for their aburi sushi set. It was not on their menu but you can inquire it from their waitress
5
I revisited this restaurant last night after about 4 years. I took a foodie mate for dinner. There are two sittings around a teriyaki hot plate chef station. My tip is watch what they conjure up before you choose food. It is mouth watering, it is inspiring and whatever you go for will be outstanding. Watch a chef de shell 4 tiger prawns in seconds then serve up a dish to die for in 30 seconds. Great place to take a friend, a partner or clients all will be impressed and it won't break the bank - a hidden ge

I brought my wife there for dinner on Valentine's Day and despite spending $400 plus for both of us, my wife walked out saying she was still hungry!!! And mind you, she is not a big eater!!For that kind of money, we could have a fantastic dinner at any of the top notch Chinese restaurant around. And for that amount or something a little more we could also have great sushi/Japanese meal at some other Japanese restaurant.We each ordered a "sushi for 1 person" at $120++ per person and was expecting to be served a piece at a time from the sushi chef cross the bar. But alas, about 10 pieces of quite ordinary sushi, with many pieces of the "space filler" tuna Maki(this should be there on the plate in the first place! This is only fit for those sushi conveyor belts!!) were unceremoniously plonked onto a plate and shoved in front of our face! My wife is a great cook at home and when I asked her if the fishes in the sushi were fresh, she shook her head very vigorously. I got the message and that would be the last time I am going to this restaurant!And to add insult to injury, the restaurant overbooked such that when we arrived at 8.20pm for our 8.30pm booking, one of the waitresses snapped "your booking is at 8.30pm". We were told to wait at some humid and uncomfortable seats outside the restaurant awaiting our turn. At 8.39pm, we were still not called to a table! Fancy the waitress having to cheek to snap at us that our booking was at 8.30pm and yet they could not get a table ready! Then I noticed a few diners coming later than us and were ushered straight to a table. That got on my nerve and so I went up to a waitress to enquire about this bad-mannered and unethical queue jumping. "Oh those diners are seated at a different type of table from you", the waitress replied! "But how do you know what kind of food we want to have when we have not been asked since our arrival??", I replied. The waitress started to get worried and with a minute or two, finally came to usher us to the first available seats which happened to be sushi seats(we did not indicate that we wanted sushi!)Overall, service standard was only so-so and this restaurant is way, way over-rated.My wife and I came out amazed that so many diners were willingly to part with such money in a second rated restaurant like this! Unless they too like us were first-timer to this restaurant?? Or was it a case of "a fool and his money are soon parted"?

Tatsuya's food is incredibly overpriced for the quality and amount of food. Visited recently with two other friends and we ordered two aburi chirashis, two portions of black sesame ice cream and an additional miso soup. The total bill came up to S$444 for three people. A bowl of aburi chirashi was S$180, which, for a measly portion was massively overpriced. It did taste good - aburi was seared to perfection and fish was fresh, but was it worth the price? No. For S$180, There are plenty of Japanese restaurants out in Singapore of comparable quality but for a fraction of the price

This is one of the best tasting Japanese Restaurants in town, from the sushi which is really fresh, to the cooked food, which is also one of their specialties. However, it is not cheap whatsoever. If you must ask how much is the food, then don't eat here. However, if you want delicious consistent Japanese Dining, this is the place to go
5
Food is fresh and of very high quality. Service is good but it is rather packed during work day lunch time. The Bento sets are nice but one should try their many Aburi dishes. We had the Aburi sushi which was very good. Definitely highly recommended if you are into Japanese food
5
Tatsuya rates highly in the Japanese restaurants category in Singapore so I was lucky to be able to have the opportunity to lunch here. 3 of us were seated at the counter and it was clear that the restaurant was fully booked for lunch and very busy.I was told that the lunch bento sets are among the best in Singapore and priced competitively with the other fine dining Japanese restaurants. However, my friend, who is a regular here ordered off the menu for me. She ordered the famed aburi chirashi bowl - available in 2 sizes i.e. SGD150 and SGD180. We ordered the former as wanted to try some other items. Aburi is a term for torched whereby the sushi chef uses a blowtorch to torch various premium seafood ingredients e.g. toro, scallop, caviar, uni, sweet shrimp, salmon etc. on top of seasoned sushi rice. I could also smell hints of truffle oil infused with the rice. It was insanely delicious! I would recommend this dish to anyone who dines here!Besides that, I also tried the seared wagyu beef sushi with pan fried foei gras which was also superb
4
Taste is very good, service is excellent, nothing to complain about.
Omakasi is still the best choice to have in Tatsuya. Price is about Singapore dollar 450 per person.
5
Restaurant was recommended by a friend and this is probably the best sushi restaurant I've tried in Singapore. (of course Japan is the best)
We stayed in Singapore for 3 days and everyday we are here! 2 thumbs up!
4
This is one of the better Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Food are fresh and service is good. Although the price is on the higher side.
Recommended.
3
Visited here for lunch. A bit pricy but considering the location and decor, it was acceptable. Food was good however not much memorable dishes. Service was fair for its price.
3
Another omikase in a restaurant where I love to go. This one was disappointing. The food was of course good but lacked wow factor this time. When I got the bill it has now gone up to $450 a head excluding wine. It's too much.
5
During my stay in Singapore I went to this restaurant. I have been told that this restaurant is pretty new and owned by a tv chef.When you step into this restaurant you really get the feeling that you are in Japan; the restaurant is exactly the same as the restaurants in Japan. I really loved the interior!You have two options; you could eat a la carte or the food that has been freshly prepared on a plate in front of you. We had the a la carte. It is very difficult to choose the food, because you have too many options and some menus are in Japanese!Luckily there are some prepared menus as well which makes it much easier for you. We had five courses and all dishes were delicious! They also looked beautiful!The quality of the food is very good, unfortunately this is a quite expensive restaurant
5
Beautiful timeless setting, excellent service by the ladies in the house. Quality of fish is one of the best, but they receive it fresh every morning from Tokyo. Taking into consideration the fish import I do find it a bit overpriced. I would come here again thoug
3
Prices aside, was the food good? Yes. Considering the prices, was the food exceptional? No. Many times no. The aburi sushi we had was perfectly done and deserves special mention. Not many places do them like Tatsuya. But other than that the other items we had were pretty ordinary. The sashimi platter we ordered was what you'd expect from any other Japanese restaurant of similar caliber except prices were about 25% higher (hubby and I had a similar meal at another restaurant just the week before). Tatsuya is very well-established aka old and has very little ambience. Counter seating is of cos always more intimate and interesting. But so is counter seating elsewhere. Service was not poor, but average. Hubby and I spent S$450/USD320 (incl 2 beer) and left the restaurant dissatisfied - both in tummy and experience

I do regret to give this vote but until Singapore has people like this it is what it deserves. I have been going to Japan since 1984 and I lived in Singapore for 4 years in the 90's and I can guarantee to you that I know my sushi. The place looks good and most of the fare is fair, what happened is that we ordered Oh-Toro Sashimi and we got pieces very red and full of nerves, sitting at the Sushi Bar I watched the guy cut our pieces from a dismal looking piece and I damned myself for ordering it (we were the only westerners or Matzalleh as we are called here).After a while somebody else ordered Oh-Toro and all of a sudden a pinkish piece with tiny white stripes appeared....I felt insulte

Visited in mid-Aug 2015 and ordered the omakase ($300) and the chef's selection sushi ($200).Here's the trick when dining at a Japanese restaurant: you must know the chef or you won't get the best servings. This is the global truth. Probably applies to all restaurants. Tatsuya is no different.The omakase was good. The quality of the produce is high, was presented beautifully, tasted good and was satisfying.I'd seen on the food network some guy raving about tatsuya's sushi in the segment 'Best thing i ever ate, singapore' and it looked like what we were served in a tiny, obscure sushi restaurant in Tokyo (don't know the actual name but it was called siu-do-ku in Japanese).So I ordered the chef's selection sushi. They brought out 9 pieces in all, 4 or 5 blow-torches, and 1 portion of a tuna-maki. All in one go, not served by the piece.How was it? The rice fell apart on 3 of the pieces and was cold. The slices of fish was about an index finger's width and length. With a restaurant like this, I will assume that they buy good produce. But the presentation (all the pieces delivered in one go), I didn't care for. Also, the rice -- it fell short, very short, of a good sushi restaurant in Japan (and i'm not referencing anything with stars from the travel guide). Most disappointing though was that I didn't get the character of the fish with each bite/swallow. In Japan, you can feel/understand the discipline and craft the instant you take a bite into the fish. Not here. It lacks character. I recall having a relatively cheap sushi (3600yen) set at the Tsukiji market last winter and in spite of the uncomfortably small setting, the sushi bled character in each grain of rice. Again, can't say the same for Tatsuya.The thing with high-end Japanese restaurants around the world is that you expect them to deliver a quality and experience similar to that served in Japan. Did they bring Japan to Singapore in Tatsuya? Absolutely not. That made it disappointing.Having said that, it is good for a Japanese restaurant in Singapore. Would I go again if I had to pick up the tab? Nope. Are there better options in Singapore? Absolutely

Food is good..fish are very fresh.
The Wagyu beef is of very high quality.
Service is fine.
One of the more authentic Japanese restaurant in Singapore.
5
Of all the Japanese fine dining restaurant in Singapore, Tatsuya is the best. One should go to there at least once to experience the exquisite food. Other than their Chirashi and Sashimi, the must try would be their Aburi Sushi.
2
The food is alright, fresh and taste good. However nothing is remarkable and i felt like i didnt eat anything after the meal. I spent 200/person for its chef special set or whatever ( cant remember the name). Disappointed for overall experience.
5
It was the finest Japanese food I have ever eaten and watching the skill of the chefs was an added bonus. The service was impeccably. Wonderful city location
5
Really nice environment, inside and outside, quite relaxed place. Excellent service, kind service assistant, absolutely tasteful. Highly recommend chef's nigiri sushi selection.
5
Arriving at 9pm we were still warmly recieved. Given a moist warm towel we sat at the gorgeous bar.I opted for the chef's surprise and was blown away by the delight on my tastebuds from the raw and semi torched slices of fish to dessert. The tempura was also done to perfection.This was the first time I got fresh wasabi paste. I loved it, wow!Service was efficient, helpful and refreshing. The bill matched the quality which is definitely Michelin star worthy.One of the chefs had the previous day placed second in a world renowned sushi competition in Japan. Congratulations and thankyou !

Tatsuya is one of our favorite Japanese restaurants because the miso cod, aburi sushi, and agedashi tofu are so delicious. We have been used to arriving without a reservation for lunch, but this time all four tables inside were reserved, so we sat on the terrace outside. The overhead fans were not enough to keep us cool enough to enjoy the food to the maximum.For some reason miso cod was not available, so we had teriyaki cod, which was quite tasty but not as delicate as the miso cod. The agedashi tofu was excellent, as well as the aburi salmon sushi, plum wine, and Hokkaido caramel ice cream. Perhaps because of the mid-day heat, we were eager to leave, and it seemed that the bill took some time to arrive. We felt so hot toward the end of the meal that we were impatient to pay the bill and leave. After what seemed a long wait, the bill arrived. The cost was comparatively high, but so is the quality of the food. We still feel Tatsuya is a good deal
4
Have been to Tatsuya many times, simply because non of the other Japanese restaurant in Singapore that I had been to could beat this.The seafood was of very good quality. But what makes me come back again and again are the friendly staff and chefs, that makes dining an enjoyable and relaxed event.This is the 1st time I tried uni (sea urchin) on its shell
5
Service is super! Waitress remembered my daughter and my allergies and our preferences too!! Super attentive :-)Food is super fresh!!Omakase is the fantastic as the section is varied! Even though I ate there 3 times in 3 weeks they remembered what i ate, my likes and allergies and I didn't have anything duplicated unless i specifically asked for it!! I would go back there just for their Omakase everyday if I could:-
5
I ordered Omakase here and the experience was fantastic, we just advised the chef when we wanted the next type and he always obliged... ingredients and creativity was right up there with the best I've experienced for Omakase. If your very hungry, expect to spend a fortune but it certainly is worth a try for a special occasion
5
Sashimi was fresh, together with other raw food. The thing that impressed me most is the professionalism of the chef preparing the food with passion and skills. Tried the common California maki, and the texture was way beyond common!
2
Spend almost 1thousand for two person here. And left disappointed and not even full.
Food was ordinary, food made was in the rush.
1
We were served by a waiter who didn't care about the guests. It really spoiled our appetite and ruined the feeling.
5
We have not eaten at many Japanese restaurants before, so we were quite surprised at the format of the room, all facing the chefs. Pleasantly surprised with the food, all totally fresh and prepared in front of you.
4
I had the sushi set for dinner which costs SGD200 for 10 pieces of perfectly sized sushi. The sushi were amazing and I ordered a few other additional dishes as I was a tad bit hungry that day. The beef we had, had a nice marbling and it was melt in your mouth good. Service was ok, they were packed the day I was there so I think they were a little understaffed. I've always had very attentive staff serve me in higher end Japanese restaurants but due to the peak dining hour, I didn't enjoy the kind the service I was expecting. The chef only noticed we were leaving after we got up from the bar and took a few steps to the exit. A bit to work on the service but apart from that, I would be happy to return.
5
The sushi and sashimi we were presented was probably the best I have tried...I regularly visit well known Japanese restaurants such as Nobu and Zuma etc.... but I would be very happy to give them up for this restaurant! The fish is of superb quality, the Chefs treat the ingredients with respect and knowledge and the end result is special. I would strongly recommend a booking for seats at the bar opposite the sushi Chef, who does not speak English but does not stop smiling....and ask him for his own favourite dishes: you will be blown away
5
Sit at the bar here and you'll be treated to the ballet of these master sushi chefs painstakingly practicing their craft. It's possibly the most refined sushi experience in town and you'll pay for the privilege.It's expensive, but you're only going to get the best. The restaurant regularly hosts the who's who from the region, everyone from billionaires to celebrities flock to this place and you can be sure you'll be rubbing elbows with the elite every night.I always go for the aburi kaiseki. But honestly, you simply can't go wrong here. Everything is so fresh and perfectly done that if you find something wrong, it's most likely you and not the food.Be sure to make a reservation because the bar is small and it's where you'll want to be to watch the chefs at work. I felt like I had to earn my stripes here because during my first few visits it was quite intimidating sitting amongst such established company, and the service staff didn't know me, but once they do, they warm up and go out of their way for you
2
The service is below average. The food is average. We went there for dinner and sat at sushi counter. We order sushi by chefs' selection. 10 pieces cost $200 (+ appetizer). Not really that authentic, mainly aburi sushi (too much sauce over powering the freshness and sweetness of the fish). I don't really enjoy it because it was crowded, noisy and they expect you to eat at the fast speed. They try to maximise it to two seating.
4
First time visiting after hearing about its affordable premium sushi. Tatsuya is the grand-daddy of Japanese cuisine and its freshness in preparing and attention to detail is unrivalled. We are seated at the counter table and we can watch the chefs do their magic. We went for the lunch set bentos. They were quite addorable around $35-$50. Portion was served decently but importantly you can taste the uniqueness of each items and were fresh. If there are one place you want to bring someone to impress while not burning a big hole, this is the place to be. Service was impeccable and top-notch.
3
Had a business lunch for 3 on a week day. allowed the chef to decide the menu for us (my mistake!). Only thing we specified was we weren't hungry. We weren't in a special room, just an ordinary table outside. Bill came up to 1200 SGD. Ouch! Food and service was good. But 400 per head is more than some of the best restaurants in Japan! And usually lunch costs half of dinner most places... Imagine what dinner would cost?...
4
Had lunch at Tatsuya during my short stay in Singapore. My friend and I ordered the bento boxes (Sashimi and Unagi) which taste quite good. Combined with its modern interior, I think it deserves four stars.
5
Try the famour beef bowl. the meat will melt in your mouth. they serve the best beef bowl in town. abit pricey but worth it
4
been here couple of times. always a nice experience. great fresh sashimi. presentation is awesome. service is fast. expensive as hell. but hey it is tatsuya. i heard shinji at raffles hotel is better though. will try it next.
5
First trip there was amazing, my partner and I had an Aburi Chirashi. But due to a lack of time, we were only able to enjoy that.So for our second visit, we decided to have the omakase. The staff was extremely flexible about our dietary restrictions and they came up with a variety of exciting courses. But the main attraction - the chefs. The sushi chefs at the counter are almost inhuman in their precision and their experience. From the way they expertly slice the freshest slabs of fish, to their skill in using the blowtorch to create different flavours.The aburi sushi is simply one of the best things I've had in life. The chef has carefully balanced each piece to give the ultimate umami taste, mixing amber-jack with caviar and hotate with foie gras, as well as less fusion pieces (so its true taste can be enjoyed) like the botan ebi and the otoro.Service was excellent, my glass of green tea was always filled and each course had an introduction (though sometimes I could not hear it).I recommend a visit to this establishment, to experience what Japanese dining in Singapore has to offer
5
Am impressed by the food here but am even more impressed with the service. The waitresses were cheery and smiley, super polite and shockingly attentive. They never stopped taking our iced green tea glasses away to add not just green tea but to top up the ice so we always had a full glass of ice cold green tea in front of us. Incredibly, I even received an automated thank you SMS for our patronage the day after from the boss of the restaurant. Consider me very, very impressed and no, thank YOU instead, Tatsuya, for showing us Singaporeans the level of service every restaurant in Singapore should be aiming to emulate
1
Valentine dinner - booked in advance.. Left waiting 45 minutes outside after our reservation time. And we were not alone , believe me..people were lining up outside ..Mr Ronny s excuse ? The " chef " ? That he had three services to take care of ... The restaurant was factually in a state of chaos. For 350 Dollars per pax, I m sorry but that is not acceptable , a total mockery of the service industry. In a respectable restaurant, there is no chaos, no yelling at clients , no aggressiveness. If you can't manage three services, just do two as a start ..don't try to charge 350 dollars on Valentine s days and insult your clients please. Plenty of good Japanese places in Singapore - Shinji, Aoki , Sushi Ichi with Japanese hospitality .
5
Let's make it loud&clear: Tatsuya is expensive.Ingredients selection is outstanding.Let the counter Chefs inspire you and take you belly up.By comparison, Shinji is even a worse rip-off but it is Japan imported into Singapore. Tatsuya is Singapore revisiting Japan and it is very, very well done, with inspiration, creativity and utmost attention to the best ingredients. Have you tried the fresh salon rose during the (very) short season? I could kill. All I've got to say
5
We visit this Jap restaurant quite regularly. It has been a fantastic experience every time. While we normally go for the bento sets (lunch only), we have also sampled California handroll, aburi beef sushi, chirashi bowl etc. I would and have recommend my frens to visit this restaurant for good Jap food. I would say for the freshness and effort that went into the food the price is reasonable
5
I took a group of colleagues here for lunch today - I thought it was excellent, and they enjoyed it but said it "wasn't mind-blowing" - they must have eaten in some very fancy places...We all had the bento boxes, plus a variety of sushi and other dishes - special mention for the salmon sushi, the beef in ginger, and also the black sesame ice-cream. We ate in the dining room at the back, but there is also a (very long) sushi bar, and that was very popular, even at lunch time.We ate very well, and - without any alcoholic drinks - the bill came to around $80 a head. I thought it was an excellent meal, and I will certainly return - but apparently if you want your mind blown by Japanese cuisine, you need to try somewhere else :
3
We ordered from the menu and while the ingredients were fresh, I did not enjoy the taste of the sushi rolls. Did not find it worth the price and doubt I will visit again.The half baked sushi (it is not on the menu) was exceptional though and it is a must have. We sat outside and service was a bit slow - would recommend sitting inside
3
It was a pleasant dinner. My friend and I enjoyed watching the chefs preparing food for us. You can tell the chef what are your preferences on food. Quite good experience.
5
We came here for lunch and sat at the sushi bar.
The sushi is creative, beautiful and best of all, delicious!
Sure, it's expensive, but you don't get this at your everyday sushi bar/train.
5
This is by far the best sushi I have ever eaten. The price is certainly high, but I have not had anything that compares... I've no words to express.
4
Great lunch bento options. You can't go wrong with any of the lunch set ($35-40). The food might take a while but that's because they prepared it from scratch. They also imported all their fish from Japan, so you'll have a very good quality of sashimi.We recommend for you to make a reservation beforehand and ask for the sushi bar table, so that you can watch the chef prepared all the foods. We'll comeback again if we ever in Singapore
4
Came here for lunch today to try the sushi. A la carte is quite expensive so we opted for the bento boxes: one sashimi bento and one chirashi bento. Both were very decent and reasonably priced. All up including taxes we paid $96 SGD. I'd visit again at lunchtime
2
I had rave reviews of the place from an ex colleague so we finally lunched there when we could find someone to take care of our baby. felt like it was a waste of time and money. I can't taste the difference between this and sushi teh. outdoor seating was also way too hot and uncomfortable.
5
The sushi prepared at the Sushi bar was excellent. The specialty seemed to be a brief torch on the top of the Sushi (usually on a sauce) which crisped the flavors onto the fish, really excellent taste. The Sapporo Beer on tap goes very well with the meal. The Ume Shisho Maki (shiso leaves, nori, rice and sometimes, cucumber) was great for more vegetables. Finishing the meal with an excellent Miso Shiru. This was an expensive meal but all the pieces were very high quality and taste and presentation was excellent
3
I have heard many great reviews about Tatsuya and so had high expectations before my visit. W had a family lunch and all of us ordered the set menu which was pricey at $250/head.Considering the price, I obviously had high expectations of the food. While the food was tasty including fresh sashimi and pretty presentation (which is expected from fine Japanese cuisine), I was disappointed as there are many other fine dining Japanese restaurants of similar calibre at more reasonable prices and more generous portions
5
Let's make it loud&clear: Tatsuya is expensive.Ingredients selection is outstanding.Let the counter Chefs inspire you and take you belly up.By comparison, Shinji is even a worse rip-off but it is Japan imported into Singapore. Tatsuya is Singapore revisiting Japan and it is very, very well done, with inspiration, creativity and utmost attention to the best ingredients. Have you tried the fresh salon rose during the (very) short season? I could kill. All I've got to say
4
Besides having the best service you can get in singapore ( it's so hard to find places with friendly and capable staff!), they also have a good mix of traditional japanese food as well as some slight fusion - ish type food. I don't particularly like fusion, but they do it in a tasty way that's great for people who get irked by raw food
5
Sitting at the counter, watching the chefs prepare the food, was exceeded only by the diversity and the quality proferred. Especially worthy of note is the exquisite Kobe beef and the soft shell crab maki rolls. The service rates in my top 10 all time.
5
Had a wonderful time at Tatsuya over the weekend. Omakase was exceptional. Attention to quality and experience: flawless. Chef Ron Leo was attentive throughout, paying attention to pace each dish. He explained how each dish should be consumed for the best experience.The recommended beef rice was superb (as common as it sounds). The beef was cooked to perfection, melt in mouth goodness. Everyone visiting should try it. If you are going with one other person, try one portion of omakase and another dish to share, portion is enough. It'll be easier on the pocket and they do not frown on it. We spent $500+ for two. To complete the wonderful experience, we received a thank you SMS from the restaurant the next day. Highly recommended for special occasions. It's pricey but well worth it.
3
Good sushi but definitely not worth the hefty$200 price tag for a one plate sushi meal. Nice presentation, good quality but each piece of fish was on the smaller side.For this price for lunch we would prefer to dine at other fine japanese restaurants where we are served omakase style with more generous portions instead of small sushi pieces we were served. Will not return for this though the set lunch ordered was decent both quality and price wise
5
Quality of food, freshness of fish is just unmatched. The Chef Ronnie and his team are permanently createing new combinations of Sushi and Sashimi. However they should not over do it. Sometimes a very simple Sushi is best when the fish is of the quality Tatsuya is offering. Tatsuya is a must when in Singapor
5
i repeat the best sushi in town, however the price is very steep and expensive.all the food is great, we got the chef recommendations. a must stop to spent all your money on food when you are in Singapore.P.S. Lee Kuan Yew likes to eat here
5
Beautifully presented dishes, with a careful attention to the harmony of ingredients in every mouthful. made the meal a marvelous experience.The smoked goose (aigamo gunsen), fresh succulent sashimi (toro/tuna belly, kanpachi/amberjack, kajiki/marlin jack, tai/snapper) and Japanese pumpkin with sword fish were all delicious. Sushi was exceptional because of the fragrant tasty rice of perfect consistency - otoro/seared tuna belly, shimaaji/seared Spanish mackerel, negitoro maki are recommended.The tachiuo bata yaki/panfried belt fish with butter was superb.Must try the Hokkaido caramel ice cream - served in cubes with the top carefully flamed to give a crisp coating
5
Our favourite meal in Singapore. Ever. Yes, it's expensive, but you get over it and realise you just had an out-of-body experience of raw (and perhaps blow-torched) fish.We sat at the sushi bar and were awed by the chef's before we even tasted the food. Then we ordered and ate. Then we told the chef to serve us whatever he wanted, and ate some more. I'm not eloquent enough to describe the food. It's just amazing. Further, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and set amidst the Goodwood Park Hotel, which is one of those super-cool heritage spots of Singapore. Save up, take your lady, and spend some time checking out the hotel before you sit down for dinner. Then take your time and go with it
4
Let's be clear: you have to go to this restaurant only if you don't really mind taking your visa out. We were not expecting to see such high prices (I was not able to find the menu on the Internet and on TripAdvisor it is writtin "Price Range - 0$ - 88$). Once you have passed this "OMG!", you just have two possibilities: to leave or to enjoy the experience.The service is great, and being inside offers you the possibility to admire Sushi Masters preparing your platter. We went for a regular sushi plate ($120) and a special sushi plate ($200), with one glass of wine and one bottle of water. It is a pleasure to see the cook executing his art in front of you, and at this stage, you would like to try everything ! Sushis were great, quiet original and surprising for about half of them (about 8-10 sushis per plate), but it stays sushi ! If we come back we will go for a 9/10 courses menu at 280$ - a budget. I agree with the previous comment saying that the atmosphere is not romantic and it is a shame. I specially appreciated the perfect service, the possibility to have a scarf (the AC is very cold), and the spectacle looking at Sushis Masters. Sushis were very good - but in the end you still end up with a very high bill

Located at the quaint and heritage looking Goodwood Park hotel on Scotts Road in Singapore this little hidden treasure is tucked away to one side of the hotel …… From the moment you enter you are greeted politely and immediately seated granted that you had made a reservation which one should because there is a very limited capacity ….. the chefs are all across the counter and your server quickly asks you if you want Omakase (Chefs choice) or if you would like to see the menu and takes your drinks order …. If you know what you want to eat and what you like I always suggest looking at the menu because only you know your tastes and preferences and dietary restrictions best. We started off with the Tuna and Salmon Sashimi which was sublime, next we had the hokkaido scallops topped with foie gras and torched which were also excellent , next came the seared beef which was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth, the reverse california roll which followed also hit the spot, and lastly we had the puffer fish which was mouth wateringly tasty!!!! Wow wow wow!!! One of my best Japanese meals ever and a must go for anyone who loves Japanese cuisine!!

It was a birthday treat for me and my friend chose this restaurant, knowing that I fancy Japanese food. I was excited as I had heard lots of good reviews. As we entered, I was impressed with the layout - guests are seated at a long counter behind which the chefs prepare the intricate dishes right in front of you. We were shown to our seats promptly by the hostess dressed in kimonos.We opted for the seasonal menu where the chefs come up with 10 course of dishes with the season ingredients. The dishes were generally excellent and service was also good - the waitress served our food and drinks promptly, and explained each dish to us patiently.My only complaint was the ambience. I would fine dining to be conducted in a more quiet and reserved atmosphere. Unfortunately, some of the staff and local diners were speaking quite loudly in a mixture of English, Mandarin and Singlish. I just returned from Japan 1 week ago and service there is generally extremely refined and graceful: people speak softly and courteously, and there is an artistic motion in every movement. Perhaps I am being unfair in expecting similar standards in Singapore. However, I felt almost awkward to hear a cacophony of Singlish, English and Mandarin in a supposedly fine dining experience. It would perhaps suit the atmosphere of a Japanese restaurant better to have the staff speak more softly.The bill came up to about $850 for two persons. I would still recommend the restaurant for the excellent food but I would not recommend it for a romantic occasion for the bad ambience
3
Very very expensive and food uninteresting, have eaten much better sushi in Italy believe it or not. Service slow, fish reasonably fresh but really nothing to write home about. Outside terrace overlooking the parking lot. Even the hotel's cafeteria does better than this
5
best sushi in town. I have not had such fresh and nice sushi for a long time. the service is very good too.
3
I finally tried the bento set lunch after hearing so much about it. I had the sashimi set with grilled unagi, and my partner had the sushi set. Each set is S$45 before taxes and service charge.Both sets were good, the fish were fresh, the tempura was cooked just right and the chawamushi was so soft with a slight hint of yuzu.The portion was reasonably big for the price
3
Brought my customer down for lunch. We opted for the sushi omakase ..was served the first piece at 12.30 pm .at 2 pm the last of the 10 pieces was served to us .Out of the 10 which include salmon .chu toro ..maguro ..and couple of white fish ..which I m not sure if they are hamachi or hirame .8 were torch flamed ..which is pretty disappointing considering its 135 sgd for 10 aburi sushi .Didnt see chef ronnie thou .
5
It was as simple as that: we sat in front of the chef and asked him to prepare whatever he warned and when he checked out after one hour and ten dishes we asked him to go on. At the end we had an endless series of Tasty food from sushi and sashimi to Kobe and tempura mixing all possible types of fish, seafood, caviars...... Also the bill was unforgettable but really worth of i
4
I Love Sushi but the sushi that they serve here is beyond my expectations!The last time I've tried this kind of food is when I was in Japan.The Japanese food here was really authentic.I also like their chinese food selections. The restaurant is located inside the Goodwood park Hotel around 5 mins walk from the Orchard MRT.Price is expensive but worth a try!Staff are friendly
5
Consistently attentive service. The seafood is flown in fresh and certified. The lunch bento boxes at 25-30SGD are a steal. Beer is always served perfectly chilled. Try the omakase (chef's choice) dinner when feeling indulgent (more than 150 SGDpp) and sit across the Itamae-san on the sushi counter. Go with his choice of sake. Simply exquisite

This is my second review and I would give it six stars if I could. Had the all you can eat (and hope your dinner guest is paying) omikase or whatever the appropriate name for this exqusiite feast is. Andy took care of us and described himself as the sergeant major of the kitchen. The man is a genius. He served us a cold rice dish at the end, which I will not even try to describe, which was one of the best things I have eaten in my life. It was fresh, slightly crunchy and utterly original (to me at least). This restaurant costs and arm and a leg, it spoils your visits to your local sushi bar, and yet is an experience you will never forget. Utterly superb. One of the top five meals I have had in my life. If it is better in Japan, tell me where and I am going..

Its our third visit here and its once more a lovely experience. As usual we ordered a selection of our favourite sushi and sashimi and we will get the manager and the chef to recommend the other dishes and the seasonal catch. We have the counter seats for this visit and we were very glad we did as we get to see the chef preparing the dishes like its a work of art. We really enjoyed the recommended dishes as every time its something new in terms of flavor, ingredients and presentation. In general the food, service has been consistent and good. The manager is knowledge about the food and always available to recommend and explain on the different dish or the latest seasonal ingredients. And the location is great as we always enjoy the walk to orchard road after our lovely dinner. Recommended !!

I am a big sashimi/sushi fan, and on a recent trip to Singapore, was lured here by the raving reviews for this restaurant. I had Omakase.It was good, but at SGD 420++ per person, that was a complete rip-off. I was told later that for the same price, I could have gone to Waku Ghin by Chef Tetsuya Wakuda (not to be confused with this Tatsuya; Wakuda-san is Japanese, Tatsuya sushi chefs are mainly Chinese) and have a really wow experience, or Sushi Ichi a few blocks away, or Shinji by Kanesaka - they are also more authentically Japanese. This was the most expensive rip-off I encountered on the restaurant scene in Singapore. Unfortunately, it was not the only one..

Great food, Great service. But seriously the sushi was the best. Maybe one of the best sushi we had while visiting Singapore. We ordered cod fish after our sushi, but the sushi was much better.
Staff were attentive and friendly.
Enjoy!

Yes - it´s expensive ! and - yes - it´s not spacey at all.No - it´s not romantic.But: it offers perfect food, exceptional and creative Sushi, perfect Wagyu dishes and a very attentive chefs who takes care for you (and max. 2 other people).If you have allergies: tell them. If you don´t like something: advice them not to prepare it. It will work out really good. I have a lot of allergies (including tofu, celery, ...) and they managed them all without any limitation within the dishes.If you really love food you will be very satisfied with things like Nigiri with truffled caviar and foie gras melted over white fish (just to give an example). Some restaurants proclaim to offer "innovative Sushi", but at Tatsuya you really can experience it.By the way: we had green tea only and it was free of charge
5
I love that place. Sit down on the Sushi bar, ask the chef to prepare whatever he wants, how can it become better? All sushi/sashimi served were of excellent quality. Every plate a surprise. Beautiful to look how everything is prepared fresh right away. I go there again! Even if not cheap
4
The quality of the food at Tatsuya is without a doubt very good or somewhere up there, although I wouldn't put it at par with Hide Yamamoto or Nadaman or even Mikuni. However, both their Kaiseki and omakase meals are 'must tries' as Chef Ronnie uses only the freshest seasonal ingredients air flown from different parts of Japan. The sushi and sashimi are also delectable.Service-wise, the restaurant pales in comparison with other more popular Japanese restaurants
4
Used to be real good but something has changed I am not sure about it. But i still come back and eat sushi sashimi here. I enjoy sitting at the bar by myself and have the Omakase ( i'll leave it to you ) by the Chef ( ita chou ? ) i have two favorite Japanese restaurants and Tatsuya is one of them.
4
Restaurant is newly renovated. Brighter, more spaceous and relaxing ambience. Food: Food standard has been the same since it first started years back. Price has increased about 10-15%. Sashimi set is abt $45 b4 taxes and service charge. Service: Chef Ronnie came and send greetings before and after meal. Service staff responded when we look up.Highly recommend (",)Need to make reservations early, might not get seats if walk in
5
We came here for dinner after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. Actually, I am not a Japanese food expert, but I do eat out a lot and coming here was my idea.The restaurant was easy to find since it's near the city. We loved sashimi most. The sashimi were freshly flown in in the morning. Although we sat at the sushi bar, it was quite interesting to see the chefs interacting with the customers and handling the fresh produce. Grilled Clam & Mayo and Corn Fritter were very tasting. The waitress make great suggestions specially regarding some of the seasonal fish and letting the chef surprise you. She was also helpful on choosing the amount of food. It is a little pricey but it is worth every penny.Highly recommended and hope to return again as often as possible
5
I have been to this place countless times. If u want to pay a visit, do call them and request for a counter seat. That's where u have a view of the stock of the day and of course, the chef at work. They prepare the sushi and sashimi with such dedication almost a work of art. The stock are at is freshest on Tuesday and Friday, when they arrive from japan. Price is definitely upmarket. Expect the bill to be abt 1k for 2-3 pax excluding alcohol if u are on chef menu. The F1 team always dines there when they are in town.

We understand why Tatsuya is so popular. We arrived for lunch, fresh off the plane, at about 2 pm and learned that last order was 2:30 pm and the restaurant closed at 3. We had agedashi tofu: no bonita flakes, but delicious sauce made it more than worth while. We had miso cod which also was delicious with the rice. When we entered past the long wooden sushi bar (longest in Singapore), we saw the chef using a blowtorch to sear the top of aburi sushi. We had shrimp and swordfish aburi sushi, and both were delicious. We learned later that salmon aburi sushi is their specialty. For dessert we recommend Hokkaido caramel ice cream and black sesame ice cream. We missed the spectacle of the chef blowtorching the aburi sushi, but we enjoyed the luxurious privacy of an empty small room with six tables. Even though our small room was a bit remote, the staff checked in on us regularly and provided prompt service. This was our first meal at Tatsuya, so we can't remember when the prices were lower, but we felt the prices were commensurate with the quality of the food and service. We recommend Tatsuya, mainly for their aburi sushi. We can hardly wait to go back
5
we went to Tatsuya for the lunch bento. Sushi set was very good. the fish were fresh. tempura was just cooked right and the chawamushi with a hint of yuzu was refreshing. the owner of the restaurant also shared the secret of fresh sashimi. according to the chef owner Mr Chia, fish has to be aged at least 8 hours before serving. he said fresh fish will not take the same as the sushi. Since the sushi was very good, he knows what he is talkin.we made reservation for the following Sunday already
5
Omakase was the best meal in my life. Everything is very fresh and unique. Our own chef kept making food for 3 hours and kept asking if we had enough. When we said no, he whipped up something special each time for all of us.
4
The restaurant looks very japanese inside, less outside. The food is excellent but the portions quantity is a bit limited. The owner has been very nice and welcoming. I would come again whether again in Singapore.

i am a regular client of this restaurant. but decided to try them after its new renovations. the food quality we ordered was acceptable. but the prices have sky rocketed and a real rip off. i guess the owner needs to recover his renovation costs etc , but there is a limit . the local public are not stupid either. we ordered 2 aburi sushi plates for my wife and i. on each plate were 4 small pieces of sushi , supposedly done in a flashy manner. each plate cost us $100 and there is no way it should cost this much for 4 small pieces of sushi. we had no drinks and just 3 oysters , one hiram sashimi. and the bill came close to $400. there is no way their food is near to that of hashida at the mandarin gallery. at hashida , the owner is japanese and all the counter staff are japanese. so you are getting the real deal. at tatsuya , the owner is local and the counter staff mostly from malaysia. it's sad that greed has got the better of tatsuya. there are many other japanese restaurants where you can get a better value for your food and better quality. it cannot try to be and charge like a 5 star restaurant when it is not. just because the decor has improved does not mean that the quality of the food has increased. sadly , it has not. stay away unless you have deep pockets
3
We used to come here for lunch or dinner at least once a month before Tatsuya was closed for renovations. After the relaunch we came back for lunch and found that the food was just as good, service was significantly poorer and food prices a lot higher. While we understand the need to increase prices due to food inflation, it needs to come with a better overall dining experience. Service was slow although the restaurant was only half full. I waited more than 15 minutes for the bill and actually went to the counter to pay it. Our tables were not cleared even after half an hour of finishing our meal. This is sadly our favourite Japanese restaurant in Singapore no more. Don't think we'll be back anytime soon.

bento sets start from $35 dollars and above. we decided to order ala-carte because we didn't want too much carbo. had salad, tempura prawn, whole grilled fish, followed by the aburi set. The aburi set is very interesting, delicious and creative. every mouthful was simply yummy. i was still thinking about it all the way till dinner time. it costs a whooping $90 though. the chefs are very professional and good. overall a very very enjoyable dining experience. reservations are recommended
5
My girlfriends brought me here for my birthday lunch as we heard quite a lot of good reviews. We ordered the set lunch bento and I had the one with unagi, tempura & sashimi. We all love the sashimi that were so fresh. Price at $45++ seems reasonable as the standard of food is really great. We all enjoyed the food so much and would definitely recommend this restaurant to our other friends
5
On business in Singapore and decided to treat my two hard working colleagues to the best Japanese food I have ever tasted. I've been here three times before and each time someone else has paid the bill. Paying yourself does take the shine off a little as this was dinner at eleven hundred Sing dollars for three. But the quality is so good... can sashimi and sushi be fresher? Sit a the counter if you can and look at it this way: the chefs are highly trained craftsmen creating a superb experience just for you. Superb fresh ingredients prepared from scratch into simple but explosive combinations. The big downside is that your local sushi bar will just never be good enough again
3
We came here for dinner after reading reviews on Trip Advisor.The first thing I noticed about the menu was the price - this was more expensive than the best Japanese restaurant I had ever eaten at! We ordered sashimi for 2 and some flounder sashimi, unagi and soft shell crab, along with two green teas and a glass of plum wine. There was not much food in each dish, so it really wasn't enough for three people and it cost over $300. We were still hungry after dinner.The sashimi was fresh, but not the best I have ever had. The food selection did seem a bit limited to me.I have eaten at a lot of good Japanese restaurants and I would probably not come back here, as although the food was tasty, it did not seem like good value given the prices
4
Decided to come here for lunch after an absence of 6-7 years. I first ate here more than 10 years ago when they were at their former orchard road location, now called knightsbridge mallThey are so popular that there are 2 seatings for weekend lunch, 12-115pm and 130-3pm. Doesn't sound bad at first, but when i am actually here, you feel the service rush and factory-like atmosphere, not exactly great if you're paying premium pricesI ordered the sushi bento set while my friend had the sashimi+eel set. Also ordered a seperate side of octopus sashimi which was my friend's fav. 5 pcs of octopus arrived, and while fresh and good tasting, i wondered if it was worth $25. The bento sets arrived and didn't look impressive. My sushi fish were small slivers and the tempura that came with it were also small. My friend's eel were also tiny slivers. That's why they priced it at $45 and even then, i believe they are earning tremendous marginsThere are moments of brilliance like the citrus enhanced chawanmushi but the sashimi portions and ambience were not ideal. Much rather pay double at Shinji and get triple the value and ambienc
5
What a treat this was! Fresh, delicious and oh so yummy! A birthday treat for my sister who has a craving for sashimi that is almost as fresh as those from Tsukiji market in Tokyo. Tatsuya provided just that. The sashimi were freshly flown in in the morning, and as my sister puts it: "it almost feels like the flesh (the fish) just left its organs". absolutely fresh and each mouthful of the sushi, sashimi, chawanmushi, tempura tasted just heavenly! interior of the restaurant was pleasant and looked new, probably because they just renovated. Although we sat at the sushi bar, it was quite interesting to see the chefs interacting with the customers and handling the fresh produce. it is a little pricey for lunch bento at $45++ but it is worth every penny. Do book in advance as restaurant seems to be rather packed and we had a strict 1 hour eating time from 12 noon to 1pmonly slight minus point: the aircon was dripping on me throughout my meal. slight annoyanc
5
stumbled upon tatsuya while looking for tetsuya...no regrets, one of the most memorable meals in Singapore.
5
Space maybe a bit tight at the Sushi bar, however it's simply worth it as you can see the Chefs in action. I almost thought I was watching "Jiro Dreams of Sushi".
Bento sets are amazing value!
Overall pleased with the whole experience.
5
10 of us eat here and we were recommended to leave it to the staff and the chef's surprise. So pleased we did cannot praise the food enough. The chefs interacted with the whole party checking we were happy and pleased with the food. It made the experience very specialTry and get a seat in front of the chefs. Try the abrui sushi platter ---- amazing!Bring lots of credit on your card
5
I highly recommend and challenge any sushi lovers to try out Tatsuya, the omakase is just out of this world. I ordered just a few things since it was lunch time and ended up ordering for a second round. The sushi men at the bar are really friendly and funny. Loved it!
5
We went to this restaurant after reading all the reviews and in spite of the positive reviews we were still positively surprised! They have different options but the best is to let them help you. The waitress make great suggestions specially regarding some of the seasonal fish and letting the chef surprise you. She was also helpful on choosing the amount of food. When you go there let them make some suggestions, you won't regret it. Perhaps prepare your credit card because it is expensive but totally worh it
4
We had the lunch box at tatsuya. Unfortunately we haven t booked so we stayed outside on the terrace. The waitress was really nice. The food is good, fish is fresh. We tried the sushi and the sashimi bentos which are approx 30 sing dollards each.Service was also quick. It was one of my best japanese restaurant. Thanks for the good experience
4
We went to Tatsuya on a Friday night without reservations, and were almost turned away by the host as the place was packed. This was about to be the 3rd time in a row a Japanese restaurant turn us away due to limited seats. Fortunately, Ronnie showed up and after some consideration allowed us to be seated and ordered the chef's recommendation for us. The omakase style is a welcome break from French fine dining, and the food was delicious. The most memorable were the tuna toro, sea urchin chawanmushi, yam with foie gras and assorted aburi sushi. The only reason this meal did not get 5 stars is because they missed 1 wagyu course, and we only found out after we noticed other guests getting it and confirmed this by reading the menu again. Great friendly chefs, great food and nice atmosphere, we will definitely be returning
5
I am not a Japanese food expert, but I do eat out a lot. This was something special Went on a friday without reservation and were seated in a lively atmosphere at the sushi bar. All bites, dishes is too big a word, are made by the 'your' chef of service and are served seconds after they've been arranged. We had various sashimi bites. All fish was extremely fresh and tender. The flavoures were exquisite and this has truly been a special dining experience. Given the price this is not something I would do every week, but I am already looking out for the next occasion that may serve as a good excuse to go
5
We read the review for Tatsuya on line and went there without a reservation on a Saturday night. They fortunately had space for us at the sushi bar and we found ourselves in a fun, friendly and lively atmosphere.The service was exceptional - genuinely friendly and attentive, very intimate but not overbearing.The 'action' behind the sushi bar was good fun to watch and join in with.The prices were not as high as we had thought they might be: although expensive, this is not as expensive as many other Japanese restaurants in Singapore and it is VERY definitely worth it.The sushi and sashimi are the freshest I have ever tasted. The sashimi was like butter it was so soft - no sinews or muscle or bone, just perfect. We did not select the set menu but asked for help from the waitress and she advised us what would be the right amount of food for the two of us - and it was perfect, we did not over order.Highly recommend the sushi and sashimi sharing plate for two. Also the hot sake - one of my favourites, this is a great version.I would go back there in a heartbeat - highly, highly recommended. If you love sushi this will be hard to beat.PLUS they stayed open til about 10.30/11ish when we left, which is late for a Japanese I think
5
This is long overdue ... but never too late I guess.Came here with the family (6 of us) for a nice dinner. Am used to the wonderful Bento set lunches but was our first time having dinner. For the menu, Ronnie (unassuming but brilliant!!) told us to leave it to him ... and what a treat. All I remember were the ''oops and aaahs" amidst the friendly banter with the owner. We left satisfied and looking forward to our next Tatsuya adventure. Well done Ronnie and team
4
Been a few times and never disappointed. The food is also great with some fusion touches to it overall. The chef and the staff are always attentive, engaging in conversation with the customers. Fresh foods and hope to return again as often as possible.
5
Best Japanese Rest in Sg..price wise was expensive but worth it. Service was good. Food recomendation was excelent. Will be back again soon for my next Singapore trip.
5
Let the chef decide what you should get. Cannot go wrong. Our second visit in 8 months and not disappointed at all. Excellent chefs at the bar counter. You see the preparations and get a peek at the amazing delicacies that get served for you to savour to your heart's delight.Unforgettable

It was my first visit to Tatsuya. The restaurant was easy to find since it's near the city. I had a sushi bento which was about S$30 dollars for the set. Being an avid fan of sushi, the sushi made here was delicate and looked like it was handmade with precision. It tasted fresh as well. My set also came with tempura, chawanmushi and a plate of fruits. The ambience was great. The chefs seem to be aware of what we were talking about (since they were making the sushis no less than 2 meters in front of us) and ordered the waitors for more tea when I asked my friend if she wanted more. A little bit of privacy might be better perhaps. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience. Definitely worth a visit or bringing that special someone. Not the place to go for an everyday meal as the price is much steeper than most places in Singapore
3
I had dinner with a client on a Monday night. Tatsuya is located on the ground floor of the Goodwood Park Hotel off Scotts Road - so a good central location. Indoor seating was full so we were seated outside - thankfully it was a pleasant evening with a cooler nearby so it was comfortable. Service wise, things started well given when we arrived there were not many people there - service then started a steady slide downward as the restaurant filled up. By the end of the meal, things slipped to the point where I had to walk in myself to request the bill - and then endured another 15 minute wait post that to sign off on my credit card - really pretty shabby!In terms of the menu, its obviously skewed towards sashimi and sushi for which the restaurant is known. It is unfortunately very limited beyond that if you're seeking a wider dining experience.The sashimi is very fresh as you would expect and the prices reflect it. The sushi is also quite good but I wouldn't describe it as special.Overall, I personally think Tatusya doesn't live up to the hype and am clearly missing something other reviewers have experienced. I'd describe it as average taking food, service and decor/ambience all into account. I'm not in a hurry to return..
3
I've been to Tatsuya numerous times but only had the Omakase recently for the very first time. It was fun sitting at the sushi counter and watch the chefs prepare the dishes right in front of you. The food is carefully prepared and nicely plated. The sushi was very fresh. While everything tastes good, it didn't blow me away. I must say I prefer Ginza Sushi Ichi over Tatsuya
5
I was beginning to think Singapore's Japanese food scene was lacking and then I found Tatsuya. Simply the best Japanese food I've had outside of Japan. Try the braised toro. Unbelievable taste and it melts in your mouth. Furthermore the environment is really peaceful. I loved all the wood - a construction element not used a lot in Singaporean restaurant
5
Have been wanting to try this place for quite some time as my friends have really good things to say about it. Despite my high expectations, my experience at Tatsuya was Exquisite. Small and delicate sushi assortment freshly made by the Japanese chef Excellent taste! Japanese-styled wooden bar counter, brimming with Japanese customers, that's a sign of authenticity and good quality! Great hospitality from the service staff
5
I wished I could visit that place more than four times a year as it never fails to impress. Get a seat in front of one of the experienced chefs, arrange for some exquisite sake or rose champagne. Food is best arranged if you let them follow their inspiration (it might be necessary to set a budget). You will be amazed.
5
I've been to Tetsuya's a few times but first time having the Omakase - special occasion for my fiance's 32nd. Sitting at the sushi counter added to the thrill, wondering and watching the 5 chefs whip up magic behind the counter. From the appetizer to the sashimi platter to the aburi sushi, it was heaven in the mouth. And the dessert was simple cut fruit - japanese fruit; a half-slice of that crazy green melon that cost a hundred but eat it and you realise why it is worth each cent to create it. Even though it cost me $700 for two person (i could have gotten another LV wallet for this :( ), it's unforgettable. Will be returning for more special occasions :
5
The resto is quaint and small just like in Japan. there is a menu byt the best would be the chef's choice. This is the freshest japanese sushi and sashimi we have ever tasted. The best ever!
5
We had the Omakase for my wife's birthday dinner. Excellent selection of dishes, one of the best Japanese restaurants I've tried in Singapore. The seafood was very fresh and the uni was really good. A tad pricey but not surprising considering the quality of ingredients served. Will be back for sure
5
Without a doubt my favourite in Singapore! Atmosphere is fantastic, as is the service and the food exquisite. The Lunch sets offer a really good value and then add some a la carte at the end (let the chef decide for you). If you like plum wine they make their own and you can purchase your selected year and they keep on site for you each time you visit. I think this is far nicer, more enjoyable and fun than Shinji. Try to get a seat at the bar as very interactive
5
We had to include a visit to Tatsuya whilst writing a travel feature on Singapore. Chef Ronnie is truly a creative genius serving the most exquisite Japanese cuisine. We had to try the Omakase, it was an artistic performance where every piece Ronnie created for us was made with love and his flavour combinations were incredible, a taste bud explosion and a pleasure for all the senses. Thank you Ronnie and all you Chefs for making our last night in Singapore unforgettable you really are inspirational
3
The omakase is brilliant, but oh so expensive (you can easily cough out $300 and up per pax)Their platter of aburi sushi is a perfect crowd pleaser. Whether you like raw fish or not, it is hard to fault this, especially when it is done with amazing seafood.And depending on the season, you get a dessert of impossibly sweet fruit. When I eat the honeydew slice here, I sometimes wonder if this is the melon that can cost up to US$200 each
5
This place does indeed live up to the hype!We booked a day earlier for a mid-week lunch. Space is a bit tight at the Sushi bar but it's totally worth it as you can see the Chefs in action. The Chefs are also very friendly and enjoy interacting with the guests when they are not busy making orders, asking for feedback and also explaining what's what in the dishes.Overall the Bento sets are an amazing value and more than enough for lunch time.A la carte items are quite pricey as it's been said before but I noticed the Sushi we got from that menu was slightly better quality than the one in the Bento set which is understandable.Overall pleased with the whole experience
2
Before I go around trying different Japanese restaurants I will warn the chef that I'm allergic to fish that is not fresh. Either you reject me straight away telling me it's better I just order tofu or guarantee me no problem ! In tatsuya, not only they are busy preparing orders for clients, they don't even care/ listen to my highlight. By nodding their heads, I assume they understood. In total I spend $200 on omakwse and sake. Afterwhich spent another $300 for A&E in east side hospital. Never will ever return again. Oh and the best part, they sent me a text message a few days later for feedback. I replied on my condition. As you can guess, there's absolutely no replies from them at all!!
5
If you crave for japanese food, and can't settle for a sushi train joint, book a table at Tatsuya. Tatsuya has a big regular following, so reservations for lunch are a must. Currently it is located at the Goodwood Park Hotel along Scotts Road. Chef Ronnie has won many awards and Tatsuya has established itself as 1 of the leading Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Omakase can be quite expensive, so if you aren't ready to splurge, don't go with omakase. Lunch Bento sets are my recommendation as at $25-$30, they are great value for good japanese food.
3
My husband's firm treated us this week to a team dinner at Tatsuya. Very impressive classy surroundings with great discreet service. I loved the salmon and we all had a few too many sakis.My husband took the bill on behalf of the table and reviewed it when we got home: nearly $300 per head plus plus plus (why do they like doing that here ?).Great experience but it was so expensive I felt kinda gross afterwards having squandered so much money on just food and drink. Maybe I'm a hippie at heart but these prices are vulgar
5
Where to start... everything is good there! Chef Ronnie is a GOD. His staff members are excellent. The selection of sashimi and sushi is great - let the chef decide for you. The quality is excellent. The lunch bento box sets are of good value. The hamachi is superb - nicely grilled to perfection. And the salmon handroll is to die for, the same goes for the soft shell crab rolls.
5
Simple Japanese Atmosphare, Super Food, not cheap but worth it. Nothing to complain.If you book for the Counter ask for a seat more inside otherwise you might end up next to the door which is not so nice,
5
My family favourite Japanese restaurant.We frequent this restaurant every other month. The set lunch is value for money. Love the Ladies lunar set. The omesaki set is excellent although pricey. If you inform the chef your budget, they could tailor the omesaki set for you.
5
Tatsuya is pricey but you pay for the quality. Everything is wonderful in Tatsuya, even the simple dish. I believe that the chef takes pride in preparing every dish and you feel their sincerity through their food. Great service, great food, great value. Whatever you order, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. It's been a while since I visit Tatsuya but do come for the Omakase. For those of you who are not familiar with the term, Omakase is a Japanese phrase which means "I'll leave it to you". That means that you will eat whatever the Chef serves you. Before your meal the chef will usually ask if you have any allergy or any food restrictions. It's best to have Omakase at the sushi bar because you can see how the Chef prepares the food. An important thing to note is that the Chef will keep on serving you food until you are full. Therefore, tell the Chef that you are full and he will go on with the dessert to end your meal.I spent about SGD 150 per person for the Omakase when I came here. It's just so good and I can't bear to not try other dish! Anyway, do try it out. I heard Lee Kuan Yew comes here sometimes to eat..
5
This place has great set lunches during weekdays. Great Value for money. For those who love cold soba, you should try their ladies lunce on the set menu. Even their unagi rice set us excellent. Their unagi has no bones in it at all. Great!!Normally the ala carte especially at the sushi bar would set one back by $500 per person for dinner. As such, the set lunch is really worth it.
3
I have dined in many many Japanese restaurants in many parts of the world. Given the portion size, setting of the restaurant, of course, quality of the meal, and good service this place is decent. BUT having Omakase for 2 and S$185 sake DO NOT equal to S$800 bill. Yes, we are used to price here in Singapore. Having dined a few reputable Japanese restaurants here, we won't be returning here regularly. Having seated in the tight bar was not a major issue, but sitting next to an overly perfumed woman in a tight bar is not pleasant. Try Nogawa in the Concorde Hotel. Can't guaranty that you won't by chance get seated next to a badly perfumed person, but sushi will be just as good and price is palatable
5
Was invited to dinner there, and was blown away by the quality and delicacy of the sushi and sashimi at Tatsuya. Had the omakase, and was surprised by every dish, which we both polished off. I think the price of the meal was equally as outstanding as the meal itself, but I suppose you do pay for what you get, and this has certainly been one of the best Japanese meal I have had in Singapore. I would go back again any time
4
The lunch bento sets are value for $$$ and they use the freshest ingredients! The chawamushi is as silky as tofu and done with perfection! Simply love the service and food! Certainy a recommended place to go for value for money lunch sets! Tried the sashimi-very fresh and prepared with a twist! Reservations are a must and lunch bentos are served from Mon to Fri
5
Food: I've been to this restaurant 30+ times and it is my regular Japanese restaurant for sushi/sashimi. Most (but not all) of the produce is airflown from Japan (which accounts for some of the price). For omakase, you won't get away for less than $250/person. For a la carte, you can get away for about $150/person. It is certainly less expensive than Shinji. The highlights are: Uni (you can have the sea urchin served a couple different ways, but its pretty awesome served in the shell with yuzu on the side or as sushi topped with quail egg); Anago (the sea eel here is spectacular); some of the torched sushi is great (try the salmon belly or swordfish); the grilled cod and grilled yellowtail cheek is excellent.Drinks: The house sake is decent and reasonably priced.Ambiance: Sit at the sushi counter. I agree with some other reviewers that the counter is a little more crowded than it ought to be. I like sitting with Chef Andy. Avoid sitting at the outdoor tables.Service: Sharp. One tip would be to order directly from the sushi chefs rather than the waitresses

I've been a regular of this place on and off for 4 years ... and bring people here when I want to impress them ... purely because the food, especially the sushi and sashimi, is out of this world!!!Make sure you get a seat at the sushi counter as half the experience is watching this extremely talented, diligent and perfectionist chefs working their knives like magic wands to create the most beautiful looking food I have seen. Everything is based on 3 simple principles: The most premium ingredients, served at their most fresh, in a minimalist yet beautiful way. Chef Sasaki San is my favourite so be seated near him if you can.Just a heads up, it is expensive (go after pat day!), especially is you go "omokaze" but I think its well worth it, the meal lingers for days after

Tatsuya is a place where you let the chef fix you a meal that you have not had before - "Omakase". Just tell the senior hostess or the chef directly, what you don't want, like pork, or one of us did not want the spooky swimmers - eel, urchin etc. You don't mess about with the menu. Our son knew the place so he booked a spot for the four of us at the sushi bar 2 each at the corner so it was intimate and the family enjoyed the evening thoroughly.Our son will figure out what the celebration cost him on his credit card payment date - yes, you cannot look at the bill. Our son has a way to con himself - "I am eating in Japan, without having to pay for the return airfare". So my Average value, would be Excellent for him. Our son says, the lunch bento is of great value. For S$30 you get a wonderful meal

Based in a stunning building with excellent traditional sushi and true Japanese hospitality. Expect a hefty bill. if you dont need all the frills opt for The Fish Mart Sakuraya instead. See my review on it.

Great service, wonderful food and reasonable prices (at lunchtime!). This little gem has only one problem for customers - you need to book in advance to get in.

Had omakase with a friend prepared by Chef Kan. Great use of fresh ingredient - air freight from Japan on Tue and Fri. Preparation can be a little exotic or the purist, including torch blown sushis, foie gras, but on the whole I had an enjoyable, albeit expensive meal

Had a lunch bento here this week, upon hearing good reviews from friends. Its one of 2 Japanese restaurants on the Goodwood Park Hotel property. Bottom line, the sashimi bento set was inexpensive, but then, the food was really quite unspectacular. The sashimi portions were small, and the tuna was quite soft and flaky in texture. For the price, there is better sashimi around

In my opinion not a very good restaurant overall.I stayed at Goodwood Park Hotel (Tatsuya is located here) a few weeks ago. From the outside it seems to be a very good restaurant. So last week because the many good reviews, I decided to book a table for two on my last day in Singapore.Upon arrival, we were guided by the staff to our table. All seems fine until we started asking questions about the content of the menu. The menus were not very specific as to what will be served. But that's alright, as long as the waitress can explain the menu .... so I thought. Sadly, when we asked about the menu, we got answers like: "in this menu there is fish and vegetable". In most posh restaurants, the staff would be educated on the menu and the recommendations of the day, but this clearly is not the case. Our waitress had to ask the chef for nearly every question we had. Finally we gave up and started to point randomly at the dishes so we can get our food.Luckily the food was good and the sashimi fresh. However, the ambience is cold, unlike many other Japanese I have visited. Perhaps partly due to the service.After reading so many positive reviews, I think I must be having an unlucky day

For pictures and more reviews, visit my blog at www.ms-skinnyfat.comWhenever people mention Japanese food, one of the first names that would come to mind would be Tatsuya. I have been meaning to try their food but their booking for Restaurant Week is always snatched up (even for pre booking!). Of course, i'm not one who would simply wait for a cheap deal to visit the restaurant of my choice. Why do we need an excuse to have good food? Good thing Ben suggested Tatsuya for lunch and we managed to score a last minute reservation at the 23-seater sushi bar for 3, albeit the 1h time limit imposed on us.Helmed by Chef Ronnie Chia, 2 time Award winner for the World Gourmet Summit's Asian Ethnic Chef of the year in 2007 and 2008, Tatsuya serves one of the most exquisite sushi meals in Singapore. Is it any wonder that they fly in fresh and exotic offerings direct from the renown Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo? No worries people, the fish is safe. Though I honestly don't care if radiation kills me as long as i get the yummiest sashimi! We decided to go with the Lunch Bento sets which were reasonably priced at $26 to 30++. Actually i would say that it's darn cheap. Somehow i had this idea that a meal at Tatsuya would cost a bomb (though we have paid a lot more for Japanese before). Ben and Sue decided to go ahead with the Sushi Bento ($30.90). Given my lousy recognition skills of sashimi, i believe that it's salmon, tuna, swordfish and hamachi (i think?) sushi. Along with california roll and tamago, as well as tempura prawns and pumpkin. YUMS! That together with the silky smooth chawanmushi which had a refreshing taste to it- they added some orange peel! Interesting touch indeed.I love the Iwate sushi rice which was springy and bouncy with the right amount of stickiness. The balance of vinegar and saltiness as well as the sweetness that comes after chewing was perfect.The fish to rice ratio was obviously faultless as well. I hate it when i'm served with a huge bolus of rice with a small piece of meat and worse when it is clumpy! No such issue at Tatsuya of course. :)) The fish was nothing but the freshest as well. A little while into the meal, Ben's bento was taken away from him! We were a little bewildered. Then the chef explained that he's rearranging the position of the sushi so that it's easier for him to handle (as Ben is a leftie). How thoughtful and observant! Thumbs up for good service!As for me, i went with the Ladies Lunch ($26.80) which consisted of a Japanese potato salad, Chawanmushi, Prawn and Veg Karaage, assorted sushi and tamago with a chilled udon.I love chilled udon, especially if it's Inaniwa udon! Yums. Very cold and chewy texture that is oh so refreshing. The slender and translucent noodles when dipped in the soba sauce is absolutely appetizing. I would choose chilled udon over hot ones in a heartbeat.I'm not a big fan of vegetable karaage. I think there's usually too much flour and hence the dish isn't as crispy as the tempura version. Tatsuya's version is surprisingly light with a slight moisture. Juicy chunks of prawn coupled with thinly shredded carrots and onions fried to a light golden brown.Needless to say, we left with happy tummies. I am pretty sure i'd be coming back soon and the next time i wanna try the Kaiseki ($165) and Omakase ($200+) course! Now off to my Sunday lunch and all these talking about Jap food is making me crave for it again. I could eat this everyday for the rest of my life. :)

Japanise restaurant are usually warm place where the waiters take soft care of you. This restaurant seems all but not this: the hospitality is quiet cold and the waiters are really far from the client. The chefs are more friendly and give you more than one word. Food good but at the end we miss something. Not really expensive

Tatsuya is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore. No Michelin stars, no pretentious wait staff here. This place has remained largely unchanged in the last few years. Always popular and packed with regular customers during lunch. Recommendations:- Bento set lunches are extremely good value for money. I am a big fan of the Chirashi set.- Omakase aka "Leave it to the chef" lunch/dinner is always a special treat for me. Dinner is pricer compared to lunch although I do not really see much difference in the offering. You will get to see the owner in person during dinner though. He will be the obvious guy taking charge of the ever so busy sushi chefs.- I prefer to sit at the counter and interact with the chefs. If you can, ask for Andy. He is a talented, chatty and friendly chef with loads of flair and theatrics. Ask him for the day's special. If you are getting the omakase, he'll usually reserve something special for you. If you fancy a Japanese sushi chef, there is also one Japanese chef in Tatsuya who bears a little resemblance to Rowan Atkinson (do not tell him that though).Dress-code: NoneGiven its popularity, it is prudent to reserve a table or seats.Access: Not very wheel-chair friendly if you use the front/main entrance. However, there is a back entrance that appear relatively easier to navigate.Do not expect over fancy presentation here. This is a place where taste matters most

Recently visited Tatsuya for dinner with my fiancee and decided to go all out with the omakase menu. We did not sit at the counter as we preferred a table since it was a special occassion.At $330++, it is certainly pricey but it served the best sashimi and other memorable dishes that exceeds all expectations.I must note that the restaurant is certainly busy and not really a place to have a romantic dinner.Without a doubt, I would not hesitate to return but hopefully with somebody paying

Salmon roe is in season, simply delicious and feel the ocean in your mouth.
All sushi selection was great and in good proportion.
Owner, Ronnie is ever hospitable!

The set lunches here present absolutely great value, ranging from S$20 to S$30. However I went for the chef's recommendation menu and was completely floored. It was absolutely yummy, but at S$175, it had better be.

Had my first Japanese fine dining with Ly in Singapore. Stumble upon this restaurant online. The place is small and it gave us the feel of eating in Tokyo. Service was good and the chef assigned to cook for us Andy san was very professional and friendly. Food was great and chef was very creative. Only drawback is the price is kind of expensive. Enjoy the experience and hope to dine here again with Ly

This restaurant is situated in the vacinity of The Marina Bay Sands Hotel. This amazing chef conjures up reality from fantasy! His adventure with food is incomparable.Expensive, yes! But a once in a lifetime experience with hospitality to match. Only a few bookings are available & are taken either by e-mail(first in first serve) or through the hotel.The hotel is rather like a railway station - very impersonal - we wouldn't stay there again

Going tonight for my 4th visit in 3 months. Sit at the sushi counter and trust the chefs with their choice of sushi and sashimi. Not cheap but worth every $. Service can be as formal as you want but can be fun with the manager Reenie, her assistant Coco and their team if you want. It is very small so you must book, and request sushi counter. The room at the back lacks atmosphere.Just noticed. The restaurant has moved from the adress stated to Goodwood Park Hotel on Scotts Road. It is situated outside the main entrance

A friend of ours advised us and we followed the advice. The Food: The food we ordered was very fresh and tasty. The sushi was one of the best I ate and the side orders were great. we ordered. The price is high but the quality balances it I guess. Yet, I am sure there are other places with similar quality but lower prices in Singapore.The ambiance: The restaurant is not as cozy or inviting as it should be. First we wanted to sit by the belt, yet were ushered into a corner which was depressive and isolated. So we decided to eat outside which was a great choice

Recommended by friends we used our one night in Singapore to go here. My partner is Japanese and we both thought the sashimi and sushi was of a good standard. However the restaurant is cramped (seems the bar counter is there to provide the absolute maximum covers at cost to comfort), noisy, uncomfortable and the service was indifferent to say the least.Someone should tell the chef (Japanese gentlemen) that out side of Japan if a gaijin speaks to you in Japanese it general done for your benefit and therefore you shouldn't ignore that person or insist on answering in bad English. Additionally barking out aggressive orders to the obviously new waitresses across customers heads is not such good practice.So the food is ok but for ambience and standards of service you'd get in Japan, forget it. Waste of money

I must say that this is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever been. The food is fresh and they even have the chef comes out to say ' thank you' before we leave.It is indeed pricey but the lunch set menu is definitely a good deal. It is usually quite fully booked (there's only a few tables inside the restaurant, mostly counter seats), so we ended up sitting outside. Thanksfully it was not that hot that day but we were rather taken aback when one of the senior waitresses reprimanded a junior staff near where we were seated. It didn't dampen our wonderful lunch though. It is just too good

Great food but shockingly UNETHICAL!!! One of the best Jap restaurants in S'pore but expect to pay about $250 per pax for dinner (just for food alone). Been there several times but I was there 2 days ago at their new location at Goodwood Park Hotel and was shocked when they served each of us a tiny bowl of simple edamame (pea pods) and a tiny shooter glass of liquid with water lily. We all thought it was complimentary as they were served without options like tidbits or amuse bouche, but turned out we were charged $10 per little bowl/shooter!! That was $80 for party of 4 -- we didn't want to make a big deal of it at the time as it was a friend's birthday, but we all felt "milked" by the restaurant. Wrote to complain to owner/head chef (Ronnie) but he didn't reply. With such unscrupulous attitude, we won't be going back to restaurant! Go to Kome at Keppel Club instead -- food just as good, a little less pricey and served with a whole lot more integrity

One of the most popular Jap restaurants and rightfully so. The ingredients are freshly flown from Japan. While the bento sets are reasonably priced, the real reason for coming to Tatsuya is for their sashimi and sushi and the Chef's sampler menu which changes depending on what seasonal ingredients are available from Japan. At $150 per head, the chef's sampler menu is worth every penny you pay for

Good value set lunches. Great sushi.

Real good food, remarkable service.

One of the best Japanese restaurants in town! Fresh fish and attentive service is hard to beat!

Great Quality Sashimi and other pickings.. don't forget the sake

very good but unless willing to spend a bomb

Tokyo quality sushi; a little western flare. Do Omakase at the bar and be prepared to go broke on the bill.

Good food and service, but pricey

Food is not bad but I do wish their waitresses would stop running!

Little Japanese outlet with that authentic look for little Japanese eatery in Tokyo. Not posh in look but the salmon and tuna toro are sooooooo fresh. Chef's friendly attention to request and everything we had including the beef was excellently done. Booking is advised as the restaurant is pretty small
