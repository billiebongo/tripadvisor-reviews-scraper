Literally right across the street from where I was working what a great place for lunch. $14SG for a wonderfully tasty quickly delivered lunch. I wish I had looked a cross the street earlier

Had delivery from Uber Eats.
Salads were excellent. nice steak and chicken. Good dressing. Price was reasonable.
Would recommend, and will definitely order again.

The food is fresh and served fast. The order is done on a sheet of paper where you select the type of lunch (salad or rice etc), then meat/fish/prawn etc, then the toppings; nuts, sweetcorn, fruit, then dressing. Food costing is $11-15 depending on extras (avocado; edamame etc). I really enjoy going here on a regular basis. Real shame on the plastic take away gear; this could be replaced with recycled boxes/bags and wooded /bamboo forks; particularly given the additional $1 for takeaway.

Ordered in delivery on a lazy weekend. The food preparation was fast (but expectedly so for a salad) and delivery was quick and on time.I created my own salad so I can't blame the restaurant for the combination. Each ingredient was fresh and there was a healthy ratio of toppings to salad. For example, the broccoli was not over-boiled and was still crisp. Overall, I enjoyed the salad and would order from The Lawn again

The Lawn is set in the middle of an office development in Buona Vista it's a few minutes walk from the MRT station. We went today (Sunday) so area like a ghost town. The Lawn itself was quiet and serve was good with helpful staff. The choice is a salad bowl and you select up to 5 additional elements and a dressing to add to the base lettuce then add a hot topping as extra. The other choice is Olive Rice which comes with a small portion of salad and again you can choose a hot extra to liven it up. Rather is a reasonable amount of outside seating and there is a smallish (seats about 20) indoor air conditioned seating. I would think on a weekday this place gets busy as the food is good and reasonably price for a healthy meal. The lettuce was a Cose so fairly boring if you had the option to add a different type of lettuce say Rocket or other it would have lifted the salad completely. 2 salads and a coconut water S$23Definitely going to revisit.

My colleague recommended me to this place, The Lawn. Initially, I wasn't keen to try it out as I'm not a "green" person and i prefer to have meat than vegetables. I changed my view when i knew they have grilled meat/ fish with salad or olive rice. I tried both salad bowl and olive rice before. I still prefer their salad bowl with 5 topping, grilled teriyaki chicken and wafu dressing. it costs about $10.70/$11+. It slightly expensive but it seems healthy and guilt-free to me.Great for lunch
