Casual dining environment. Tried the century egg mee tai mak which was awesome. I went back for it again a week later. Side dish of gyoza is great too.

The place is located in Square 2, Novena with Daiso just round the corner. Their popular options include the mildly spicy stir-fried Mee Tai Mak and soupy Heng Hwa noodles. But the Buah Keluak pasta was the interesting find. The portion was good, pasta al dente and the sauce was generous.

This place is bright and cheerful. The service is pleasant and efficient, the chef is most personable. You help yourself to the cutlery. The menu is interesting and offers a most creative range of mostly local and a few European carbo dishes. The Buah Keluak Parpadelle is good, but it is an acquired taste. The dry Laksa is tasty and well balanced, but the fried Mee tai mak with century egg takes the prize!! It has good wok hei, reasonably spicy, lots of seafood ingredients and is the best dish by far. The basil pasta with tomatoes is acceptable, their kurmah horfun tasted like a Cantonese braised beef version. We were so delighted with the dishes, we kept ordering repeats of those we like, we ended up eating more than usual, and had no capacity for dessert. The next time, we will try some of their interesting desserts. None of us liked the sliced fish soup.

Was curious about this noodle place when I saw it on Deliveroo. Upon reading the reviews, I found out that they serve dry Laksa, Dry Mee Siam etc. Tried both as well as the century egg Mee Tai Mak. All excellent and tasty, noodle portion was small but sufficient for me as one won't feel guilty about eating it. Been there a couple of times since as love the noodles. The kids tried the Heng Hwa noodles as it's non spicy, I still prefer the spicy noodles

I highly recommend the Heng Hwa Noodle Soup as it is really very flavorful and the chef is very generous with the ingredients. Lunch sets are really worth it as you pay slightly under 10 bucks for a bowl of noodles, a small dish of sides and a cup of drink. However, not advisable for big eaters as the servings are not that big

We were brought here by a friend to try the local style Noodles with a twist. The shop offers dry versions of many of the Singaporean favourite Noodles, like dry Laksa, dry Mee Siam, etc. We tried the dry Laksa and dry Mee Siam and were surprised that they were really delicious.

Just wanted to share my experience today, eating at NOW Noodles+.I went in about 1.30pm and ordered my dry mee siam - this time it came with a free drink and side for $9.80 - good deal.Anyway, not wanting to ruin my appetite, I left the sides untouched and started on my mee siam when it arrived. It was so good - those who like dry mee siam, this is a place worth trying out.By the time I was done, the place had emptied out, so I took out my stack of marking to do - two classes of composition *miserable look*.The guy behind the cashier (whom I have since found out is probably the owner), came to clear my plate. But before he did that, I noticed him peering at my table first. When he finally did come to clear my plate, he placed a clean fork down for me for my appetisers. Then he also asked if I didn't eat them because they were not good. Of course, I assured him that wasn't the case.Then I continued marking. However, the droplets of water from the condensation on my cup were dripping down and getting the top of my script a little wet as I marked. I wasn't too bothered, but this same guy noticed and soon fetched a coaster for me to put my drink on.By the time I was on my last script, almost 2 hours plus had passed and I had finished my free ribena drink. I had my earphones on when the guy came to clear my cup but just smiled and nodded a thank you.To my surprise, he came back with a free refill of ribena for me!Although it's a cheap drink, I was still very touched by this kind gesture.Having worked in the service industry before for 2 months after my 'A' levels, it is rare to find the bosses doing the dirty work themselves so I was rather impressed by his impeccable service standard and the extent he took customer feedback seriously.Of course, I am not encouraging customers to do their work there. But DO try the dry mee siam! Go check out the place at Novena Square 2

For a restaurant, I think the lunch set is reasonable. It comes with a Noodles, a small side and a drink. I tried twice, the food generally not bad but the ingredients (except noodles) are quite little. Tried the fried century egg with noodles, this apparently quite good. Next I tried dry laksa, this one is slightly disappointed as the taste avarage. Side dish you can choose gyoza or sotong ball, both also nice. Drink I usually get lemongrass as I don't like the way they use tea bag for the drink

A good selection of noodles from spaghetti to macaroni. Local flavours like Dry Laksa, Dry Mee Siam and Buah Kuluek are must trys! The first 2 are spicy so be prepared for that! Spaghetti is also well done, kids love it! Place is good for lunch or after lunch meetings and has fast wifi for doing some work on laptop.

Tried the mee tai mak with Century Egg. I used to like Century Egg but quite sometime do not have it, i found the taste for both suppliers taste weird. When it served, only find out it is spicy so it covered the taste. You cannot really taste Century Egg. Lunch set include an appetizer where you can choose sotong ball and gyoza. I tried both(with system batter with colleague). Sotong ball cannot go wrong, the gyoza tasted good. Mee tai mak tasted quite good but it become more and more salty when I ate till the end
