The service is great and the salmon open sandwich with salad is amazing. The coffees are really small so I always end up ordering two. The food portions are good sizes and can easily be shared if you don't have a big appetite.

A bit expensive for indian standards but has amazing food, pizza is delicious and the mojito is just perfect, for dessert the nutella crepe with banana just feels right

Outfitted in a relaxed casual ambience like all Marché restaurants, this one comes with indoor air-conditioned and outdoor seating areas. They always have good pizzas and sandwiches every time we visit them.

I really enjoyed their bread basket. Plain but perfect. Could do with a variety of spreads though. Otherwise good coffee and comfortable place.

There are not many good western selection in Jurong east. Marche is the one you can expect above average quality and price. Average per head 30 SGD and you get what you are paying for.

this restaurant is unique place to eat in Singapore
staff are so nice
food also nice (except lobster not very good)
cost of food is also ok

Just to point out first, this is not the regular Marche, but a Menu version which has very limited items on the Menu. Ordered the salad which was for 18$ and very poor with only mix of greens, tomato and chicken! The salmon sandwich was tasteless...all in all a very disappointing experience as compared to what we usually get in other Marche

I literally found this place by accident as I was walking to a train station, and boy am I glad I found it. A little disappointed I found it a little late into my trip- but glad nonetheless.This is an amazing fresh food and drink restaurant with an open plan format. You are given a card in your entrance and you simply walk around "swiping" the food you want and then pay on your way out.I have the chicken crepe which was extremely filling - and a freshly squeezed lemon juice. I write this from my table having just finished - and next, dessert. I can't leave without trying that as well.This is such an amazing concept and high quality food everywhere - a must see during your time here.

This was recommended by my office colleagues and as we arrived at the resto, I feel in love with the ambiance of the place. It feels casual but classy at the same time. The place is spacious and the furnishings are updated and well appointed. You can choose different heights for your seats (from high chairs to lounge chairs).I tried their Beef Wrapped and it was good and the serving was huge. I'm an eater but I was not able to finish my wrap. But it was good. The portions are more than adequate.The staff were friendly and accommodating. Very quick to respond if we need anything.Would I recommend this place?YES I would

Wanted to eat at Marche for the longest time but there was always a line. Today, it was less crowded so we walked in and definitely walked out happy too.We ordered Tonight Special of Savoury Crepe - - Pulled Beef with Capsicum Spread ($16.90) and the Hawaii Pizza ($18.90). Both dishes were full of flavours and huge! Service was prompt from all the wait staff and impeccable from the lady of Myanmar origin who served us. It was a shame I didn't get her name

Enjoyed a nice lunch with my wife at Marche Movenpick. Great service and the pasta and chicken entrees we had were very tasty! Prices were reasonable for lunch special at under 15 sgd and will fill you up!! I would recommend and be back soon.

Recommended by my sister we gave the place a try and weren't disappointed. Service was fast and friendly and the breakfast was huge, delicious and not really expensive.
5
Great breakfast options and VERY generous serves at very reasonable prices. Super fresh, baking is done in house and service was terrific from Amy and Amelia. Kid friendly. Recommended.

Warm welcome and attentive staff. Bustling atmosphere with business people. Good salad and variety of other dishes on lunchtime specials.

Enjoy our meal for good deal. 1 for1 breakfast only for dine in on Monday-Friday 8am-11pm. Definitely will go again
5
At city center, very convenient in location. Pizza and pasta taste very good, all sources and foods are combined just right

Went for dinner with a couple of friends. The service was terrible - the waiters had really bad attitudes and couldn't get our order right. The food was not great - undercooked and overpriced. We couldn't wait to leave.

Walked past yesterday and thought this looked like a lovely place to eat. Table of 12 people behind me played Rock Paper Scissors the whole time I was there and I have never been to such a noisy restaurant. I would never go there and would not recommend this place as the management could have asked them to be quieter. Very disappointing given there are so many lovely restaurants around here.

This was a unique experience, when you arrive you are handed a card where you go around to the different eateries and select food which is placed on the card then when you depart you present the card and pay for what you have eaten and drunk. The food though swiss orientated has a wide variety and the drinks are excellent. Excellent choice

Was surprised that hubby suggested this place as he hated the last Marche Movenpick place we went to at Vivo City mall. Difference is that this is a choose from the menu place rather than the concept at the other restaurant. The a la carte menu was varied with a good choice (there was also a special lunch menu) with the ability to create your own pasta dishes (type of pasta, sauce and extras) which is a nice touch. My husband went with that option (tagliatelli, al fredo sauce with prawns & mushroom) and said it was very tasty, give the plate was cleared was evidence that this was true. I had the savoury chicken crepe - 3 pieces presented with a small salad was what I'd call a very generous serving. It was OK, not startling by any means, but way to much (I couldn't even finish 2 let alone 3 bits!) and was missing some sort of sauce as it was a bit dry. We asked for Sprite but what we got isn't what I'd have called Sprite - it was more "limey" but very nice none-the-less! Would eat there again but try something else

Marche has a bit of everything with a lot of it being cooked as you wait. Think Vapianos if you know that chain. Nice atmosphere, interesting layout and good food. From what I can gather reasonably priced for Singapore too, good for quick lunch!
5
Ate here a few times for breakfast and lunch and it's always been great ... nice menu's and great prices

Ordered salmon pizza and roasted chicken crepe. The crepe was good but the salmon pizza is consist of pizza base with raw lettuces, few pieces of salmon and lots of vinegar. Its kind of wet/soggy and taste sour. Something i would not recommend.

Slow service, i asked for water for 5 times!!!
Bad half cooked tasteless pasta,
Cold cheese sticks,
Never come back again
5
All the dishes here is so nice and fresh, including Pizza, pasta, salad and some meat or fish dishes. On lunch at just a few dollars extra you can add "lunch pack" which includes cold drinks, soup of the day and ice cream or coffee.I go there almost for every lunch

Truly Swiss premium quality food & price-tags for its Swiss F&B items at tropical sun-baked Mache Movenpick Restaurant @ Vivocity ! Try the fantastic mushroom or seafood pasta with crispy salad and heavenly waffles and fruit juice at 5-star price minus proper aircon comfort for a change once in a blue moon. However, the bread-n-butter pudding is a total dismay

Did some grocery shopping and needed a little treat so I came to Marche at Jem. The double chocolate cake was just nice not too sweet but cake was hard and dry except the chocolate part, felt like yesterday's food (I bake so I know). The free coffee was lovely of good quality. Service excellent despite a quiet cool afternoon the service staff were filled with energy and interest to serve. will come back as I find the service lovely but will not have cakes here. My last few experiences were delicious pizzas and salad though on some busy days they cannot give you all the attention you need but do enjoyr the good food

If you are a foodie and love to see a green European village market style ambience with amazing food spread don't think twice. When you enter you are given access cards per person , so all you need to do is go to the counter of your choice and swipe the card , billing sorted at the end ! The place is a feast to the soul for food lovers. Every counter has its own charm , it's starts with salad spreads , then the Rosti counter that has the longest queue , followed by the meat counter which has a variety of tender red meat and sausages, seafood counter with great barramundi , salmon fillets and Calamari selections and a pizza counter, I probably would have missed some for all you know. You have a good selection of refreshing drinks with Special beers of the day as well.If you enjoy potatoes with some good meat , try the German platter which has an amazing mix of German sausages , pork knuckles and roast chicken. The Rosti is the best of all , try it original style or with Kranski sausage topping or with Salmon, all are simply mouth watering.I must say , it was a very good experience and well worth the money

I seldom write reviews on restaurants but I just couldn't hold myself this time. I have been to this restaurant several times and I thought the food was just great, especially their pizzas. Wanting to celebrate my son's birthday this Sunday (May 8) and since it also falls on Mother's day, I called to make a reservation. A lady staff picked up the phone and her initial reply was that they do not accept reservation on weekends. When I told her that I have quite a big group (9 of us) and that it will be daunting task for them to put us together, she finally accepted a reservation for us at 6.30pm (I wanted 7pm but she said she can only do it at 6.30pm). All seemed well until several hours later when the same lady called and said that she can no longer accept my reservation and ask me to just walk in if I want. I questioned why and most of the time, I couldn't hear or understand what she said. Finally, she said she didn't know it's a Mother's day and that they couldn't accept reservation on Mother's day (??!!). At this point, I wasn't too happy as it appeared that she didn't care about our conversation a few hours ago and insisted that we just have to walk in. Well, so be it and I hung up the phone saying that it's fine and they are not going to see me there, not this Sunday and never again. What a terrible customer service and experience....It's disappointing when the restaurant tries to serve good food but not being reciprocate with good services

We'd had a late lunch after our flight and got peckish around 10pm so we walked out of our hotel (Fairmont) and to our delight quickly found this place. It has a really nice feel and was very busy. We shared a prosciutto and rocket thin crust pizza which was delicious then a beautifully presented mixed berry crepe which was so so yummy, not too sweet which suited us perfectly. The service was excellent and it appeared very clean. Would highly recommend this place

This is a place you have to go to at least once when in Singspore. Great for lunch or dinner. Everyone in your group will find something they like to eat.

I find it concerning when you can't even do a half decent pizza, especially when you want to charge $23 for it.. the people who say the food here is good have no taste
4
To enjoy the food at Marche is fantastic, different ambient, good food, good taste.. I like the Marche's food from mushroom... delicious...
5
The service here is fantastic. The crepes are sensational. It is reasonably priced. I had lunch and the service was quick. They also have free Wifi.

Tomato basil soup was fresh and light. The crepes were huge but healthy with loads of vegetables and some cheese. The decor of the place was modern and pleasant. The kitchen gave out some smoke as it an open concept kitchen. We felt a little " choked" by the smell . Otherwise , it was a nice meal

Loved the meal here. The waiter was really pleasant and polite. The ambience was lovely and the food was beyond amazing. I ordered the ribeye steak and my partner ordered the salmon fillet. The portion was perfect. We opted for the homemade iced tea and lemonade. We shared the banana and Nutella crepe topped with the MÃ¶venpick ice cream, it was delicious! Would definitely visit again!

After being in Singapore and having very little luck with food we went to Movenpick. The steak that I had was outstanding maybe a little less done that the rare I ordered but I normally have blu anyway so I was very happy. The meals were large and reasonably priced. Happy.
