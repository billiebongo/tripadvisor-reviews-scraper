Finally found a proper version of Bun Cha Hanoi!! It tasted great and made me reminisce about my trip to Hanoi in 2014. If only they would add more noodles....

Yummy food, plenty of choices, freshly cooked and served fast.
Recommend trying the various types of Banh Mi (Vietnamese baguette filled with chicken, fish, pork or veggie..)

Better go before 12noon or after 1pm, super crowded and hard to get a table during peak lunch hour. Nice Bun Cha set meal with Lemongrass drink. Super big bowl of noodle with pork meats, vegetables and the soup taste is so refreshing and appetite.

Arrived to an empty space with loud music but within the span of 20 minutes the noise of the customers chatting away outdid the music!! The food was outstanding, portions big, wait time minimal, staff friendly, atmosphere great and price very reasonable!! Can’t wait to go back to try many of the dishes on offer. *From noon till 1:30ish, it’s super crowded with office staff. I got there at 11:30 but doors open at 11am

We were told to give Uncle Ho a look see. A canteen-like atmosphere visually greets you upon entry. The menu is simply all Vietnamese street food; and the 8 of us were ready to try everything. For starters, 3 beers and you get one free. 2 orders of Drinks settled the immediate thirst, and subsequent 'wash-me-down' requirements with the food. 3 varieties of Bahn mi, beef ball soup, Vietnamese salad (signature item), crispy spring rolls as well as the soft-skinned rice rolls were among the various food bites tried. Uncle Ho personally comes out and tends to you, making the selections that much easier...it's Vietnam in a warehouse. Tip : it's a real canteen primarily serving the day-time office workers. So...if planning a dinner, get there by 7pm latest, coz they start shutting down by 9pm. Price point : we were greedy and chowed down several repeat items, plus the grog. All-in it didn't exceed $20/pax. Access : bus stop nearby, car park in the building, cabs plying the main Pasir Panjang Road means easy to get there and out. As we were leaving that night, some within the group were already talking about when we would return for the next meal here.

Food - so so if you ask me. Overly flavourful. Portioning was good but the usual free flow of veg that is common in Viet was not practiced.Premise - spacious enough and with basic decor, it does what it needs to do. Nothing to say much about it.Crowd - on the ground floor of an office building, crowd are mainly office groups. Beat the potential rush hour by coming early but was there till 1245pm and plenty of seats were still avail.Staff - I guess they are trying to replicate the Viet attitude more than the food as I saw no smiles from cashier nor server. The only gleaming smile came from the old uncle who was clearing the tables. Verdict - nah. It's 700m away from my house but I won't go there again. Not worth it and left no impression. I guess it did not help I was there with some Viet friends who didn't finish the food not due to portion but due to the lack of authentic taste

This was our first visit to a Vietnamese restaurant. We wanted our children (11 & 13) to experience the different foods of Asia, and with Singapore being the foodie capital, Uncle Ho Tuckshop seemed the perfect place to try. We had heard and read good things about it and saw that it was a short stroll from Pasir Panjang MRT. There was a small group of us, visiting Singapore from New Zealand. We enjoyed the salads - banana flower salad with chicken and the green mango and prawn salad; the summer spring rolls were crispy and fresh; the fried spring rolls were nice and crunchy and not too oily; Nem Lui (meat wrapped around lemongrass skewers) - yummy; we had Bun Bo Nam Bo and Bun Thit Ga Juong, both dry noodles, one chicken and one beef, a mix of new flavours that stimulated our palates; a favourite for the boys was the Lemongrass chicken chop and the caramel pork banh mi. We were spoilt and satisfied. After 5 days of eating Chinese food, Indian food, Nonya food and hotel breakfasts, we were pleased to have been able to discover a new taste sensation. The service was excellent and the staff were helpful in describing the dishes to us. Next time I visit Singapore (which won't be soon enough) I'll be sure to return

Affordable food. Banh mi is fantastic ! The bread is Crispy and freshly baked. The beef noodle pho is good as well. Thin slices of fresh beef. Owner is willing to do vegetarian version for item no on the menu. Excellent staff, warm and friendly. Must visit

Nice place – crowded at lunchtime apparently because of the office crowd…. Very simple process …. You go up to the counter, order and pay… good authentic Vietnamese fare at a reasonable price. All I would say is that if there is a group or a couple of couples , you cannot just add to your “tab” and pay at the end. You have to pay every time you go up and order a new dish or bottle of beer …. It’s justthe way the till works … Very nice staff though ….Nearest MRT – Pasir Panjang … and its’s down a side street across the road

We have been to this little Uncle Ho tuckshop tucked away along Pasir Panjang road quite a few times for dinner mostly so we cannot comment on the lunch time crowd. It is not crowded during dinner time.The owners/staff have always been very friendly recommending us what to eat and even how to eat them. We like the Hanoi BunCha so we ordered it often. However when we were there this week, they have introduced many new items because it is their 1st year anniversary. We tried the mango and prawn salad - very good with the crunchy mango and prawns. We also had the dried chicken noodle - the chicken was not as fragrant as it should be but nevertheless I would order it again. The noodles goes very well with the leaves and gravy. The grilled beef with rice was highly recommended by the staff, we found it tasty but quite normal.The hot pandan and lemon grass drink is good. Since it is brewed in the shop, it is not too sweet. We always order it to complement our meal.A good place to have a casual Vietnamese meal
