There we're various cooking style for crab. Singapore is famous for black pepper and chilli crab. However, I found that seafood international came up of Thai curry crab. It was super delicious. Not forgetting to order garlic bread dipped with the sauce. So tasty.

Visited for CNY Dinner, food on the good expectation side with very organized kitchen and nice scenery view from table. Shark Fin Soup and Pen Cai was very nice and the portion was great. Will return again!

Great place to dine with family and friends with live seafood exhibits for kids to learn about their habitat, a graden with 3 roosters to roam and crow and a pond of koi to marvel. Great team of servers, attentive and customer centric.

Quite good Duck, served with pancakes first, then noodles for second course. They forgot our vegetable dish, and charged us $20 for corkage, but otherwise a good job

Food rating: 2/5Ambience : 4/5Service: 3/5Value: 3/5Well, the food is not too bad, we ordered salted egg prawn, chilli crab & cod fish. Needless to say, the seafood is fresh for sure! What brings down the score is that the food is so so but not the best we tasted, in fact we felt that some zi char stalls have better food for much lower price. Salted egg prawn: salted egg taste minimal, no curry leaves, so less fragrant than the rest we tasted.Chilli crab: too starchy for my liking. Somehow there is not much aroma/fragrance... not as good as jumbo (ecp) and no signboard.Cod fish: fresh, best dish out of the 3 we ordered here.Staffs are not very proactive, we have to constantly request for them to refill our tea. However, they were pretty quick to clear your plates full of crab shells!Therefore i think it's the cups coz they were unable to see how much tea is left...Won't be back for more, coz there are better places to spend the money... Sorry to say that..

Located at East Coast, there are plenty of parking. If you can't find a parking lot, you may valet your vehicle. For tourist, please take a cab, not very assessable by bus. The seafood are fresh and has a good variety to select. You basically go over to the tanks and select your favorite live seafood and indicate your favorite style of cooking. Since it fresh and live, the food doesn't come cheap. Per head is about $110. They serve beer, fresh coconut, fresh fruits and variety of desserts.  Enjoy!

Located at the old Big Splash with few carpark lots, this restaurant has been here for decades. There is valet parking if needed. Very friendly and mostly senior staff, the ambience and decor is that of a Chinese restaurant.First thing that you need to do here is check out the prices listed on the tanks containing the seafood where you have to plan your seafood dinner with all that awesome live seafood.We started with my fav sashimi, Geoduck and a must when in Singapore, Chilli Crabs. For me, I preferred the Crabs cooked with salted egg yolk. Kids love the steamed and fried buns and dipping into the Chilli crab sauce. Choose Sri Lankan crabs if they are available with bigger blue claws. Not to be missed is the cheese baked lobster. Mild chedder cheese is used and hence not to cheesey

this restaurant is a 3 mins drive from my house and every time when we ran out of places to dine, this restaurant will pop up.We love the claypot fish soup. though the waiting time for this is slightly longer, it's a must try! I would say we had it no less than 5 times and it's consistently good. the seafood beehoon is also a must try. my 3 yr old daughter loves it and she's a picky eaterFor fresh seafood, you can actually choose your own crab, fish etc as they have rows of fishtanks at the entrance, so you know it is FRESH!the chili and pepper crabs are also good.. highly recommended!!Ohhh.. the restaurant do not serve any pork dishes but it's also not halal.

We ordered a live Australian Lobster sashimi. The sashimi was very well prepared and very fresh. After finishing this sashimi course, they will take the remaining shells and the lobster head to cook their next dish which is the seafood beehoon. That is by far, the best seafood beehoon we had every tasted. Extremely tasty! The service in Seafood International was excellent and the staff were very friendly

I'm visit this place countless time, so far the cooking standard are stable, food price reasonable to me.
Will be visit this 25 Feb 2015 again for my third visit for this month.

have been there several times. several private rooms for gathering($600 per table of minimum spending). In my opinion, this is the best seafood restaurant in Singapore, considering the budget and quality of the foods. Chili Crab. Bamboo Clam w/ garlic strongly recommended.

Your pick the live seafood and they will cook for you. Good food and ambience. They also provide private room and is good for business, family and friends gathering. Cheers!

I really loved this place! Perhaps because I am American, and this was my first trip to Asia, but I have never been to a seafood restaurant quite like this one. I loved the idea that you shop for your dinner fish live! You are ensured to have a fresh catch that way. I was amazed by all of the sea creatures that I have never seen before. There are so many interesting choices! I was there with a family from Singapore, so they recommended what would be best for us to try. It was overwhelming. After you choose your sea creatures and check out with your grocery cart, they ask you how you would like your fish prepared, and then they seat you in the resturant. I can't remember the exact dishes we had. I more remember the experience, and having some of the best seafood of my life! I would highly recommend visiting Seafood International

We had round table for seven for business dinner. Many large tanks with live seafood to view and select. We had a selection of items - chili crab, black pepper crab, razor clams being the three most notable. Food was hot to the table and server was attentive to needs.

It is a restaurant for family with nice sea view and after meal walks on the beach. Our three generation family visited on Saturday for brunch but were informed that they have stopped serving brunch since last month, We were slightly disappointed but found that their new menu had all the dishes were wanted to eat viz.Crisp-fried Baby Squids, Deep-fried Tilapia with Homemade Thai Basil Chilli Sauce Sautéed Fish Fillet with Home Made Foie Duck Paste Sauce, Stir-fried Crayfish with Creamy Butter Sauce, Pan-fried Carrot Cake with Fresh Scallop in XO Chilli Sauce, Pan-fried Seafood Bee Hoon with Shredded Pumpkin and Sautéed Mussels in Indonesian Spicy Sauce (and found it Smelly & Spicy). Each dish was for 4 persons and nicely cooked and presented. Staff was very helpful and correctly advised us. The overall experience left a nice feeling of fulfilment. The pond outside had a nice collection of turtles. Our grand child enjoyed watching them

It's been quite some that I visited them. Recently my customer from overseas came to visit me and would like to eat seafood. Seafood international first came into my mind.The place till now still have a friendly staff and nice and fresh seafood.We get to choose what we want just like going to the supermarket. Once we are done shopping for our stuff that we would like to eat, we can let the staff know the way we want it to be cook.There is one dish that I always order and that is the white pepper crab. It's still taste the same as it was.The sitting arrangement and the food is always the drawing things that make me like it.Parking is convenient too.This is a seafood restaurant that I will always recommend to my friend

You can't go wrong picking crab here - a choice of styles and all of it was superb.The rest of the seafood looked equally as good, but we were a bit limited on choice due to my wife being a Celiac.Really quick service (even if the service was a little bit quirky - one of our waitresses was trying to convert us into becoming born-again Christians) and we could not fault the food.You will need to book and cost was on average with what good eating in Singapore costs these days

First time here - usually go to Jumbo or No Signboard. Quite a large place with pleasant environment. Had Black Pepper crab and Chili crab. Both good but the pepper crab was better. Also had snails, tofu with mushrooms and chicken which were all good. Service was just OK as it took 2 different waiters and a supervisor to get a drink order. The price is a little more than other places but it was reasonable. Will give it another try in the future

We made a reservation for today because we wanted to have some fresh, whole fish.On arrival we went to the tanks to have a look at all the "live seafood", to our surprise we saw 5 dead fish floating in cloudy water. No need to say our desire gor seafood vanished. We told the hostess about the dead fish, she just brave us a shy smile, no apologies, nothing.Think twice before going there
