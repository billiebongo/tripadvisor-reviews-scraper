First time eating at the place as a family. Pleasant experience with good service and the food was pretty good - good serving and tasty. Love their Steam Seabass and Black Crab.
Will definitely come back soon.

I was meeting an old friend from way back so pretty much anywhere would have been OK for our first get together in more than 25 years. Ginger Thai offers good food and friendly service. At 107 SGD for two, it didn't come cheap though.

A very nice little restaurant. The food was excellent and the service first-rate.The manager came to enquire if all was well with the food, (I don't usually like that much attention, but on this occasion, it was a reassuring experience.) The waitress was attentive, pleasant and welcoming. Overall, a very pleasant time

 : I visited ginger Thai 2 days ago during the Chinese New Year period. It was really a busy hour when I visited it but the staff there were really sweet and nice to me. I ordered pad Thai n Thai milk tea, The food did take a bit longer to arrive but Iâ€™m sure it was worth the wait! The food was truly yummy! This is not the first time I have visited ginger Thai and the service and food has always been consistent and tasty! Ginger Thai is really my favourite place to dine in

Ginger Thai is conveniently located and has a nice set-up. The food is very good, although it is a bit pricey. The service staff are very friendly too!

We were starting the shopping journey and bumped into this restaurant off Orchard Rd. Great find, great food especially the Calamari and Satay. But everything was delicious.

I had chosen this place for my father in law celebration. As he likes Asian food, i decided to choose this place

We found this restaurant in a street of small restaurants and decided to give it a go. It was a good decision; the food was good and very tasty and arrived hot, they catered for some little changes we wanted to a couple of dishes and everyone was very friendly and the food was served efficiently. It is a bit on the pricey side but then so is everything else in that part of Singapore

This is a small place and serves good Thai food. Veg and Non-Veg options available. Slightly on expensive side

This is a Thai restaurant amongst the group of restaurants in Cuppage Street, a popular place to eat and drink just off Orchard Road. It's a buzzing place with plenty of options, on the higher side of pricing that street food due to the tourist location. The Thai restaurant was pleasant enough, the staff in particular are very attentive. We had the ginger beef and chicken with basil and chill which were both good. Portions on the smaller side

Prices are steep for the quality of food. House wine (white) served was not cold.There are better Thai food in the city area

Food and service was great. Just that the food portion (soup, we ordered the larger bowl) but the amount is as less as normal one. However, service crew was great and helpful. Thank you for the awesome service
