Idky so low rank, but definitely a noteworthy visit if touring sg.
Morning business only

This place sell the best siew mai, char siew pau and fan choy. Normally have long queue and best time to buy is in between meal time where the crowd will be lesser. Quality wise so far has not fail me.

Long queues anytime of the day and any day of the week mean the food being sold are freshly cooked. Must try when visiting Singapore.

The standard of the dim sum has fallen, and the display case full of snacks is a thing of the past. The toa payoh branch is usually almost empty. The cha siew pau tasted just sweet... I would rate average as it is not value for money when standard has dropped and price goes up

Decided to try the pork pau after several recommendations and were not disappointed. Very popular take away food outlet that has a constant queue of customers. The pau is basically a steamed bun with delicious pork content. We tried it as a quick snack, but we will go back for more and to try the chicken pau as well

This review is for their central kitchen along Outram Road where they churn out the snacks for delivery to other branches. Their handmade char siew pau has soft and fluffy skin with juicy and meaty char siew. Don't confuse this with those from restaurants/hotels. We always pack along our other favourites which include the lor mai kai (chicken with glutinous rice), fun choi (rice with char siew, hard boiled egg and Chinese sausage), siew mai (pork dumplings) and big pau (mixed of chicken and pork fillings). These snacks are good for all day.

The siew mai is delicious. Can eat 8 Siew Mai's in one go. The carrot cake is also very soft and crunchy. Siew mai cost S$0.80 per piece and it is very crunchy and tasty. A must eat for their siew mai. Can try their Lor Mai Kai, Po Piah and other tasty snack. Can buy and eat along the way while shopping

Always freshly made, still tasty but compared to before their standard has slightly dropped... But if you're first timer you'll still love it. The buns are still tasty and juicy. I'll recommend the Big Pau and Char Siew Pantry. There's some fried dim sum available but not the best in town. There's always a short queue, turnover is fast hence its not a long wait. If you're Bau lovers you may want to try Tanjong Rhu Bau, it's nicer. Just a recommendation...

Two things you need to know about this place 1) be ready to queue as the line was thirty deep the whole time we were there and 2) they don’t have a menu in English so it become an interesting game of identifying what each delicacy is and quickly making a decision when ordering. The food is fresh and a favorite with the locals, from the dumpling to their sweet options there is a lot of choice. They do a great job of keeping the queue moving but it seems never to end – highly recommend it as it is cheap, tasty and obviously a favourite with the local

Don't compare with proper sit-down dim sum restaurants, but for a stand-alone shop selling pau and snacks (a "quick-quick-what-do-you-want-to-buy-or-move-on" shop), this one is pretty good by Singapore standard. I like their char siu pau, loh-mai-kai, and fried snacks. Been going there at least once a month for last 2 years. Operating hours a bit iffy sometimes, or maybe I just don't know
