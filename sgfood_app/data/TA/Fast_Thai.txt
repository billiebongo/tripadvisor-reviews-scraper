The quality of food was better than I expected and reasonably priced. Good value for money. Recommended to those who, like myself, love Thai food

Went to Fast Thai for their famous Boneless Chicken. Their special made sauce were really an explosion of sour n sweet n slight spicy taste. Chicken meat were succulent n juicy. Also tried their Minced Chicken Fried rice which was another Thumbs up! Its a really nice fusion Thai Restaurant without the smells from nearby Goldenmile Thai eateries. Friendly staff n chef. Try their lemongrass n Thai Milk Tea too! Will definitely return again.
