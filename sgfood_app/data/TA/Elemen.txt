Atmosphere is good. Staffs are friendly and polite and food are fabulous. I will come with my family and friends again.
4
Environment is bright and good portions were just nice. But the restriction of 1.5 hours turn around was too tight. The service staff gave us our bill as an indication for us to pay the bill and leave. That was rather rush
5
great food, one of my favourite vegetarian places. a fusion of cultures. definitely will recommend to everyone.
5
simply love the thin crust, and the initial truffle scent as it gets delivered.
The portion of this pizza is sizable and could be shared by 2 pax.
5
We have always enjoy the food dinning at this place. The staff is polite n friendly. If the staff gave us food recommendation.
5
My 4th visit to this eatery in last 4 mths n i love it every time. Went with diff group n they will all say the same thing. "Super delicious, Value for Money n OMG Ididnt know its all natural n vegatarian!"
4
Was there for a business lunch. Food was good as the set menu offered soup/salad, appetiser, main course and dessert. There was a wide variety to select from to suit the different palates. Vegetarian meal need not be boring.To TOP it up , was recommended the sea salt coffee. It was worth the try. Worth the visit
5
It's so lovely to have stumbled on a decently priced healthy vegetarian restaurant that doesn't just substitute tofu or gluten for everything. The food was fresh and the flavours were delicious! Having the 8 course set was a great way to try many of the offerings on the menu. We'll definitely be back to try some more knowing that what we're eating is so good for our health
5
My family went for the 8 course set menu. The food, ambience and service were excellent and we had an enjoyable meal. Itâ€™s recommended to join the elemen membership for rebates. I also like it that the shopping centre gives out complimentary parking for spending more than $50 which could be easily achieved as the set menu cost almost $40 per pax
4
This was our first time here when we met our friends for dinner (their suggestion) as most of us are vegetarians. Most of the dishes we ordered were good. Special mention:the watermelon feta salad - very good, though I would like a wee bit more of the feta on the plate; the spinach salad was quite good too. The tofu with avocado is worth a try. On the whole, food good, service good, priced slightly on the higher side, and this is a good option if its just vegetarian fare you want
5
Nice ambiance, Food is good and special. Will be better if there are more varieties and price cheaper. Will go back again.
4
Staffs on that day were really attentive to our request. My bf dropped his knife and one staff immediately bring a new knife over for him. The ambience was good, food was awesome.
2
Food was served too fast. Told the waiter to slow down as our table was full of food. Didn't enjoy the dinner was I felt that the restaurant wanted to chase me out.
4
Good set meals. Although in booking you are advised that the dinning will be limited to 90 mins, but they don't chase you out when the 90 mins is due.
5
my go-to restaurant for vegetarian food in the city area. everything taste so good. my personal favourite is the spicy sushi and mushroom salad!
4
Food was good. New variety added to the menu. Suggestion to include 5 course set for weekend as well.
4
Good vegetarian food. Lots of choices and has indicators of egg,.milk, wine for different types of vegetarian.
Atmosphere is good to catch up with friends
4
Is pleasantly surprise that you can enjoy the course dinner meal with your family, happily chatting and relax in the environment. Price is reasonable. Great place to come visit.
5
I love the variety of vegetarian food provided by Elemen which was of high quality and standards! Great for sharing as well.
4
Can go. I would reccomend the ice cream for the dessert, it was worth it. Good ambience for couple or family. Would visit again if got occasion. Thank you. The bread is good, but i hope can have more bread sticks. otherwise, i would rate 5 star.
5
It was a good experience for my friends and I as we were celebrating the birthday of one of our Friend. We had a splendid time and food was excellent as always!
2
Compare to harbour front branch , millium branch servies is lousy and food lesser than in harbour front.
4
The service is good and efficient . Food are delicious . Atmosphere is cosy .
I will recommend friends to dine there.
5
Celebrated my birthday there with my family. Everyone was happy with whatever they ordered and the food exceeded even my father’s expectations. He was skeptical about the value of a meatless meal so it’s lovely to see him enjoy the food.
3
Overall the food is yummy but the truffle pasta was too salty on my visit recently. Hopefully just an isolated case and Elemen can maintain the food standard.
5
We opted for the five course set meal and the food was as usual, fresh, delicious and innovative.
In spite of full capacity, service was prompt and attentive. Staff ensured that we had our dessert after the mains.
4
While not the greatest ambiance considering the price of entrees, the food is quite good and beautifully presented, as well as prompt service. You do feel a bit rushed to eat and get out as they tell you at the time of booking that you have only 1-1/2 hours to eat! So this isn't a place to linger
5
I left a birthday remark in my online reservation and the restaurant called in advance to discuss about the cake and candle. We were also given the private room without asking. I appreciate the good service!The vegetarian food were cooked healthily and tasty. We enjoyed our meal there
5
My wife and I came here for a late dinner on our way to MBS. We were looking for authentic, vegetarian food and were blown away by this place. We ordered the Asian Curry Balls with Dough and the Spicy Shitake Purple Rice Sushi. They were both incredibly flavorful and had a good amount of spice. Tip: get there at least an hour before closing because they will not seat you, we say people get turned away
3
There's a time limit for each seating, not sure if its for everyday seating or just during the festive period. Had ordered 2 sets of dinner, only to realized we ain't served desserts from menu after we left but we were charged full price for that. Food seems to be filled with monosodium glutamate as it leave me and another friend thirsty after dinner. Overall taste wise still acceptable, plating is presentable too
5
My siblings who were first time there , will amazed at how vegan foods can Be so tasty, fusion and creative
4
My second visit to the restaurant with friends. Friends had 5 course meal each and enjoyed the food very much.
5
the food was delicious! but the ee-fu noodle could be a tad salty towards the end cos of the gravy. seemed a little short-staffed when the restaurant filled up. but i’ve been here a couple of times and the food never disappoints.
3
- Service was good and the food not bad.
- Hope in the future add in more variety for the food.
- Location easy to find
4
Order an 8 Course dinner. Everything was ok except the rosemary breadstick which is on the hard side as compared to the one I last tried at the restaurant.
5
Ended up there without knowing that it was vegetarian, and we ordered away, had soup, two of the pizzas (the one with the truffle is superb) that looked more like a flatbread and with generous toppings and best eaten with your hands. It is actually a great place to meet and have conversations either professionally or just personal enjoyment. Been back there several times and to my delight found there place in Vivo too so will have to go there next. Really a very popular restaurant and well run. The manager was very hands on, which was nice to see, some of the staff members perhaps could work on their English a bit as not all was always understood. But frankly it did not bother us a bit as the overall experience was that pleasant. One suggestion, bring the bill to the table and process it there rather than walking up to the cashier it is kind of not in line with the good level of overall experience
5
This is one of my many visits as each time I try to bring a different group of friends or individual. To everyone that I have introduced this restaurant to, not only like the food, the concept but find it an eye opener that a vegetarian meal can be so interesting and healthy, unlike the typical chinese traditional glutton made stuff. Very suitable for friends, families, elderly as well as kids
4
Refreshing addition to the Singapore culinary scene. Vegetarian food that’s pretty on the eyes and tasty on the palate. We shared the 8-course degustation menu. The breadsticks/yogurt dip was delicious. As was the avocado tempura roll. Dessert was average. The service was fast, efficient and productive. Just not very friendly. A lot of sighing and tongue-clicking when dealing with customers. I’ll still come back for the excellent food. Will just brace myself for a transactional experience.
5
I've brought several friends to Elemen for dinner and all of them loved it! Everything that we ordered was so incredibly good that even a friend of mine who doesn't eat vegetables loves it too. The quality and presentation of the food were great, best of all, the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend their spinach salad and sushi, sooo delicious. A special shoutout to Ken, the manager of the restaurant, for his friendliness and awesome service. We will definitely be back very soon! Thank you Elemen!
3
Mushroom pizza is still as good. The sticky date pudding is not as good since it was rather dry. The vanilla gelato was too little and rather icy. Aircon temperature is set low and hence the food gone cold quickly.Service standard has dropped further since the last I visited. Servers do not smile but rather give unwelcoming attitude. So what if the environment is designed to look soothing and welcoming when the staff have such unwelcoming and aloof attitude towards customers? When server see customers waiting in queue, they just ignored. Booked on Chope but unable to confirm the seats immediately. Found it hard to get staff's attention when they keep trying to pretend they did not see.Have always recommended friends and relatives to Elemen. But after this trip, I might not consider to go back not to even say recommend to others
4
Food is still as good as before and staffs are friendly and helpful. Affordable price for the 5-course/8-course meal with good quality of food.
5
Elemen have good food and friendly staff and the menu have change quite frequently and recommend to go again and again.
3
It was okay. There are other similar cuisines that taste better. But if you are looking for something different or a healthier food choice, Elemen could be a good alternative.
Service was excellent though. The waiters were vigilant and quick in refilling the water.
5
Had a great experience there will my family of meat eaters!! Each dish was well conceptualized and prepared. Particularly memorable are the purple rice rolls, mushroom pizza, bread sticks and the Asian curry with rice dough.
5
The experience was awesome . The crew suggests the good choice of food. The food was tastey . Really thumbs up
4
The food was overall good. Nice restaurant setting too. Not a vegetarian myself, but really enjoyed the dinner, especially the Mushroom Pizza!
4
Food & services were good. Set menu was value for money. Better to book as it’s very crowded over the weekend
4
Initally, I booked a table of 5 pax. One day before, I need to add 2 more pax. However, I cannot login to CHOPE to amend my booking. I called the restaurant directly and they amended my bookings immediately as the restaurant was not really full. The food served was rather good. If you don't mind a meal of good fusion vegetarian food, this is the best I have tasted in town
4
the food is delicious and nice. we total 8 person to order 5 set 8 course meal. The portion is just fine for us. i like the wild mushroom and white truffle pizza and EdamameTofu with Black Truffle Wild Rice. The taste is good. The environment is a bit noisy and the serve quality is poor. I need to make a request to take away the dishes before serving for few times
2
I am not a fan of vegetables and this is a vegetarian restaurant but they did have pizza and pasta but my Cousin ordered the pasta and she said it tasted weird and I ordered a pizza which tasted horrible My drink tasted very sour and overall it was just terrible. Definitely will not come here ever again
1
Hi,
We wrote our request in the comment box, but no one at the shop front knew about it. Obviously our request is not granted. The staff told us the we had go down in person to requests, when make your app redundant .
4
Enjoy the tasty food. We order the 8 course set at lunch hour. It is full house but the service is still good.
5
Exquisite dinner!
Loved the food lots.
Ken was a good host.
But the place becane quite noisy around 7.30pm.
5
The food was excellent and the ambience was clean and bright. Staff was friendly and helpful throughout my visit. The overall experience was very pleasant
3
We made a booking using the Chope app and for some strange reasons, the booking was not captured by the restaurant. It was fully booked and we had a very bad experience waiting for seats.
4
The food were unique but were slightly salty for us. The truffle pasta was great but not all dishes are nice.
We booked in advance for 8 people and were given a private room and with good service.
5
Elemen serves very unique vegetarian menu. Mushroom pizza is a good choice. They have new menu every few months.
4
We enjoyed the food and items like the tofu on the appetizer was a pleasant surprise. Getting the set would definitely be more worth it than a-la-carte items, though still a little pricey. I was a little disappointed with the service though. I do understand that the food may be served slightly slower during peak hours. However, one of my friends only received her food only after most of us had finished our dishes (and after 2 checks with the kitchen). What was most disappointing is actually the fact that the first staff did not get back to us regarding the waiting time when we first checked about the dish and we had to simply continue waiting without an idea of how long more to wait
3
Pros: One friendly staff.Lovely food.Nice decor.Aside from reason mentioned below, the rest of the food were served quickly.Cons: The rest of the staff seems patronizing.Reservation required for this branch way in advance.Noisy.Attention focused in a special group of food tasters (?), Ieaving us with food delay.Conclusion: While Thomson branch is more out of the way, the one experience I had there beats the two I had here. Will reserve at Thomson Branch in future
1
Poor service. Grumpy staff. Supposedly an established middle class restaurant but it felt like a random self service outskirts cafe. Very rushed and pressurized environment to eat, especially when one had the 8 course dinner set. They served the courses without any breather and it was absolutely rude to serve the bill together with the dessert. For the same amount paid, I could have gotten better food and service at a Japanese restaurant within the same vicinity. Noise acoustics are horrid too as there are no sound absorbers like cushion walls or carpetted flooring.
5
Have not met a friend over dinner for a long time and decided to recommended the friend to a healthy meal. She had enjoyed the food, the very friendly service & the ambience at Millenia Walk.
5
The kids love the vegetarian food here, especially the main course avocado sushi with beancurd, desert muffin with Ice cream, starter dish breadstick with yoghurt dip, mushroom truffle soup.
Highly recommended vegetarian food (with no mock meat).
4
Service Like usual but is my first time for their feedback. I love to have the 5course there . My herbal soup . Thank you Yunice and Peter
5
Went there to celebrate my friend's birthday. Food is excellent. However, the service can be improved.
5
Great staff and good food. Excellent. Must try the 8 course meal.value money. Crowded on weekend need to call for reservation
5
I like how the staff are friendly and it is good to have some of them remember me as I really go there often. So often that my friends say I should buy their stocks :P
I wish they offer new dishes soon!
5
You forget that you are having a meal that is meatless. Service is great although you might want to skip the lunch time crowd as it can get noisy.
5
Fantastic service provided by Andy. Easily the best staff of the outlet. Great beverage concoction by Andy.
4
Thinking of a lunch place to catch up with colleagues or friend, the meals here are healthy and value for money. The place is conducive for just 2 or a group of colleagues. Though the website recommends the set, you have choice of ala carte. Best way to get here is by public transport. You may like to park at the mall or hotels in this area.
2
Service staff should go for training on customer service, throughout the whole dinner experience..only 1 lady service staff is good. Firstly, they argued on our reservation on number of pax till we showed them on Chope's reservation email. Secondly, dessert order was taken wrongly but at least that lady service staff did came in and apologise. Lastly, when paying for our bill, service staff was not proactive to advise customer on any credit card promotion. Didn't complain to the manager but won't be visting the restaurant again
4
The food and service were pretty good. Good portions and i think the price is reasonable. Overall I had fun with my friends
4
Food was served rather fast hence felt a bit rush. A gentlemen in jacket, could be the manger was friendly. Overall is good.
5
Food and service were excellent! Personally love the truffle white mushroom pizza and the avocado sushi. Had curry doughballs too but just felt that the curry is not flavourful enough. Overall a very positive experience!
4
Food placement is good. Some main are good some are normal. But it's good selection for non-vegetation who wants to try some healthy food
4
Food is great! Had the 8 course lunch set and every course taste good! Love the breadstick with strawberry taste sauce. Good value for money too - $32+ for 8 course including dessert and coffee/drink.
4
Food is meticulously prepared with fresh and high quality ingredient at very reasonably price tag. Somehow have the feeling of being rush through the meal courses and not so friendly server.
3
We had the set dinner at $32.80 which is 8 course. However, I wouldnâ€™t consider the Apple vinegar palate cleanser as a course. A bit too much liquid in the set which makes you feel full initially but you get hungry thereafter (soup, drink, palate cleanser). The mains (Truffle Risotto), Soup (doubled boiled Maca) and dessert (sticky date pudding) was good and so was the drink.
4
First try at this restaurant after googling it. It's definitely yummy and felt guilt free since it's meat-free. But probably service staff need to be more attentive and customer oriented. My friend hasn't even finish her soup and the service staff want to take away her bowl without even looking at the bowl. Ambience is a bit rowdy if too crowded. Overall still recommended, would have been better if the service standard can be improved ;
4
Food was really yummy. Especially the pizza. Ambience was nice. Service could be better. Example- I had to remind the waiter twice to give us extra tissue paper because there was no tissue paper at the table. We had to twice or thrice call out the waiter to get their attendance to fill our glasses with wate
2
I always seek out a strictly vegan/vegetarian restaurant when I travel, so when I came across this place and saw the review I was really excited. The experience here unfortunately for me did not live up to the reviews. I ordered a few options to try, and while none were horrible they were at best ok. While I left full, left completely unsatisfied. The service all around was pretty awful as well. Just an all around bad experience
4
Friendly service with nice environment. 8 course meal was filling enough, hope to go back again with a new menu waiting for us
4
Great variety of food from an extensive menu that uses real ingredients, herbs, I felt that’s every penny was well-spent!
5
The staff were very friendly, checking with you every now and then how's the food. Quality of food was awesome too. I am glad my mum and myself liked the food and drinks. This was my fourth visit in September 2017.
5
Been here a few times, every time I went I just love the food more. Reasonably priced, delicious and healthy. Kids love it too!
5
Went to Elemen for Birthday celebration. All of them loves the vegetarian food even thou they are not vegetarian. One of them said will come back again because of quality vegetarian food. Cheers
4
Good food with a wide selection of dishes to choose from. Healthy choices too. The serving of the food is also very fast.
5
Second time here and does not disappoint, tasty hearty meals. Price is okay, portions and prices for mains were good but found drink prices rather steep
4
Second visit to Elemens, and the food doesn't disappoint! Our favourites were the Elemen starter, tofu salad, spinach salad, mushroom risotto with black truffles and sticky date pudding dessert. What wasn't so great was the Apple crumble which was a pretty mushy and tasted flat. The pairing of (really good quality!) apple cider was a good choice, and the coconut hot chocolate was heavenly! Overall, the restaurant is well-lit, and the overall experience was good, except where we were seated looked like they put out an extra small table to accommodate us as an afterthought (even though we had booked in advance), and the light around our area was faulty so it wasn't as well-lit where we were seated.
4
Unlike the usual Chinese vegetarian restaurants I have been, the restaurant setting is considered modern. They have 2 set menus, a 5-course meal and an 8-course meal in addition to their ala carte menu. I was there on several occasions and found out that their 5-course set menu is not available on weekends. The menu gave a fairly good description of the food and it has pictures of the food!Price wise it is not cheap but I consider this value for money. You can also sign up as a member for $30 and you will be given 2 e-vouchers of $15 each which you must use within 2 months (I think) in addition to collecting points which can be used to deduct part of the bill in you next dining. Food is tasty and the size of the serving is reasonable.Tried several of their dishes and I particularly like the Black Truffle Porcini Pasta while my friend said the Asian Curry with Dough is very good as well. A good dining experience.
5
Went here with a team of people from various regions. Ordered a variety of food in the 8 course awesome meal. The food tasted good. Every single item we ordered was made to perfection. All of use liked the food and the ambience a lot. I would definitely recommend this place to all the vegetarians and to all the non vegetarians as well.
4
Seemingly small portions of 8 course dishes but packs enough for the taste buds and fills the stomach.
4
The food and options were even more interesting and tastier than non vegetarian food. Very impressed with the menu and options. Service was great. Food was also served very quickly. Everything was just so pleasant.
4
Westernized vegetarian food! Great presentation and selection to choose from. Went there two days in a row!
4
I have went to Elemen several times and like the food there. The atmosphere is good and they have provided good service
5
The food is v good, they often change their menu and have special menu too! The latest one is Laksa risotto which i tried 👍🏻
4
Nice place for fine dining of vegetarian food. Fusion of east and western style food. 8 course set meal is very filling.
4
Provides creative mix of healthier options. Tried the purple rice sushi and sizzling brown rice, tastes great!
3
Made a booking for 7 and upon arrival, the counter staff told us that we get the private room for free because the restaurant is fully booked. The counter staff did mention that the private room usually comes at an extra charge though. So we tot we got lucky and went in. We were almost 15mins in the room with plain water served to us and waiting to place order. A server walked in, not to take our orders but asked us to move to another table outside. The counter staff put us in the private room and another staff shifted us out. This is so ridiculous but we had no choice because the server that asked us to shift did not give us a choice at all. And sitting at the table outside, nobody came to us to apologise or pour water for us until the manager came alone to apologize and gave us a 10% discount for the misunderstanding. The manager's service recovery is excellent but the staffs ought to be more well train in terms of handling customers. We are nice enough to move and not create a big fuss in the restaurant.Thumbs up for the manager. I forgot his name but it is the guy who spent 25 years in Holland. Appreciate your good service.Anyway, my family did mention that food was awesome.
3
Have not been back at Elemen for a year. The food is still enjoyable. Unfortunately service standards is totally lacking in finesse. The first waiter who sat me and brought the menu was unwelcoming to the point of being brusk and very impatient when asked questions about the menu. Food items were not served well, plates were almost banged down and shove at dinners without regard to which diner's order it was. Fortunately after the first course, we had a change in waiter (Max) who seem genuinely happy to be part of the dinner service.
3
Sadly, I fount that the asian choices on the menu were the let downs, and the western food tasted better. It's definitely good value, with you leaving full after the 5 course. But taste-wise, it's really nothing inventive or really delicious. It seemed to utilise this pre made sesame dressing repeatedly in many dishes for example, so you realise it's not really a unique menu
4
I liked the variety of options ranging from western (pizza, risotto) to Chinese (ee fu mian)! I'll recommend the quinoa brown rice stone pot, very flavourful 👍🏻
3
I found the food and ingredients just so so. The place is very noisy and the food is quite basic for the price. Need to self order from the digital pad menu which i found the service not sincere
5
Value for money
Manager was very helpful
However, staff tried to remove my cutlery and food without checking if I had finished my food ( which I haven't )
But overall it was still an enjoyable trip. Will be back again.
4
a fine restaurant at an affordable price, not a 'wide' menu but you definitely have some refined choices like a combi of edamame toufu with black truffle wild rice and kale juice..:)
4
The 8 course lunch was very enjoyable and the ingredients were all very fresh and wonderfully put together.
5
Visited for a friend's birthday dinner and food was served on time. Staff were friendly and helpful in the selection of menu.
4
Manager was very friendly and accommodating. Reach way too early before reservation time and mgr assist to keep the cake in their fridge.Food is tasty and generous serving portion. Promptly served.Only gripe is that the waiter did not asked if we are done with the dishes and just clear off the table.
3
Location: Millenia Walk (Nearest MRT Station is Promenade)Time: My family and I came at 830pm for Dinner Service Food: The food was quite good, with a good twist on the vegetarian cuisine. The 8 course set comes with 7 dishes and a drink. Each dish was unique and the flavours and textures blended synonymously. I highly recommend you to try it.Service: The service alone is bad enough that I do not plan on coming back again. I am not sure if it's the service staff working at this timing, or the way the staff are trained. The service was atrocious. When taking our order, the waiter gave a slight attitude when he realised not all of us were ordering the 8 course set. When the food came, our food was lazily placed on the side of the table and we had to get our own dishes personally. Attempting to call for service was also a chore, when I tried to ask for salt, it took 2 mins to get the attention of a service staff, who was doing something else came over and rolled her eyes before asking us "What?" This took me aback. Conclusion: The food is good but the service alone makes the dining experience a bad one
5
Excellent food served at this vegetarian restaurant. Tasty food (without mock meat). Very good service from manager as well as staff. Had the 8 course meal. Simply love the food here and would recommend to friends and family. Would definitely make repeat visit again! Must make reservations as the restaurant is really popular.
2
The 8 course menu was servicing very fast..I have not finish the 1st course, they quickly serve 2&3 courses together..What is this....The service standard drop..Then my last course dessert had to wait very long..I will probably won't consider to come back to this restaurant within this year anymore.
4
choices varied for different food categories.food outcome is well done and ambience is clean and quiet.
Allows you to choose ala-carte and also the choice of their set courses.
4
Elemen serves nice fusion vegetarian food. Their set menu is really worth the price. Good variety of food is available. Mix of western and asian cusine.
4
this 1 1st time visit this restaurant, food are nice, we like the staff there, they are frenly and cute.
4
My first visit to this restaurant. Set meal is worth it. I will definitely revisit this restaurant again.
2
tl; dr: try elsewhereMade a reservation for 2 at 6.30 pm. Restaurant was nearly empty then.Service: 1) waitress tried to seat me at the nearest table to the exit. When asked whether I could sit at the unoccupied sofa booths, she replied with a curt 'you have to request in advance'. Well, I wasn't told of this when I made the reservation2) the young male waiter who took our orders could not have looked more disinterested in his job. No smiles whatsoever.3) my dining companion and I ordered the 8 course set menu. The servers kept on serving the next course before we could finish with the current one! Had to tell them to STOP as I don't like being rushed while eating. First time encountering this in a restaurant4) to their credit, our water glasses were refilled promptly; dishes were also cleared quicklyFood:1) breadsticks could have been harder. Too soft for my liking2) The mushroom soup should ideally be served in a HOT bowl. Both the mushroom soup and pasta were delicious2) the sticky date pudding was served at room temperature. It should be warm/hot to contrast with the cold gelato and caramel sauce (which was too sweet and overpowered the pudding)3) The Iced Coconut Mint with Butterfly Pea Flower is pretty to look at. Not as nice to drinkPlace is noisy when full of diners. An interesting experience, but I will not return. There are better vegetarian options in Millennia Walk
5
As a vegetarian, I like to bring my meat-eater friends to Elemen. He commented that he was so full and the food was wholesome and delicious! The salad was so fresh and he couldn't help but used his hand to pick them up and eat them. We thoroughly enjoyed the good and wholesome food
4
Totally enjoyed this neat and pleasant restaurant in millinia walk. Love the pasta and mushroom salad.Had a bad start with the coconut juice sweet pea flower drink ( coconut flesh was rancid) but the service recovery was fast! I was offered to change my drink to lychee ice tea and was thanked for my feedback!Staff are courteous and the restaurant ambiance is nice.Enjoyed the Japanese curry noodles and watermelon salad too.Will definitely go back to try the rest of the vegetarian dishes
4
The food here is really good. The breadsticks with the raspberry yoghurt dip was to die for. My friend and I ordered 4 portions and stopped ourselves from order more. And they're not expensive. The sushi roll and the noodles were delicious but the curry can and must be avoided. The place can get very noisy so just eat and go. I loved the service. The manager found out that we loved the dip and volunteered to give us extra. One of the waiters took quite a bit of initiative and it was much appreciated
5
You forget that your are eating only vegetables. Food is very tasty, Value for money especially if you go for the 5 course set meal which you are allowed to choose from any item on the menu ( valid for dinner from Mon-Thur only though ) but if you have a bigger appetite, then go for the 8-course by topping up another $6-$7 
5
Went to Elemen for dinner recently with some friends who were there for the first time. It was a good feasting for our eyes to the beautifully arranged food and great after taste of the products. Every mouth is worth its bite, the food is just so healthy and marvellous
4
Had the set lunches a few times. Good value for money, especially for CBD area. Lots of choice and very good food. Only issue is most dishes are heavy on mushroom! Would be nice if they introduced more non-mushroom dishes.
3
Some dishes are good while others quite average. Most of the people in our group didn't feel it was worth the price. Ordering a set is definitely cheaper. Service is slow. Good to visit once for the novelty aspect
5
We enjoyed our meals very much. The food was beautifully presented and very tasty. The menu recommends ordering "a set" and we were not disapointed.
2
Food quality is still good. Service is not as attentive as before. Broken sushi served (see photo), and sushi is hastily wrapped.
5
Honestly we walked in not expecting much since we wanted a quick bite. Friendly manager.. Fantastic pizza.. salad and pasta.. regretted going to alacarte instead of the course meals.. very affordable!

Had dinner with a group of friends after knowing their new menu. Did not disappoint. The food seems better compared to last round. Service was slightly slow, but was acceptable as we were not in a hurry.Liked most of the dishes, especially the purple rice roll, black truffle porcini pasta & edamame tofu

i know its a vegan resto. and someone asked if we are vegetarians. which is a big NO. but eating at elemen, you wont feel you are a vegetarian. the taste of the food is so heavenly coupled with very attentive staff! ill bring my friends here again

I went to Millenia outlets with my mum to celebrate Mother day but it is such a disappointment dinner we had.The Braised Bailing Mushroom with Ee Fu Noodle comes with too much sauce compare to Thomson outlets is totally different taste. Worst part is the serving of beverage Lavender Tea serve in a small cup and explained short of pot which is ridiculous reasons. Also the tea leaves in the tea bag is so little and does not soluble in such a small cup so the staff give me extra tea bag but also comes lesser tea leaves too, feel that I am drinking a plain water comes with bags of smell. The Neighbouring customer also order the same beverage but end up not finishing it too. The most outrageous part is our last dessert served us very late which I have been keep chasing then twice and your staff wear in Long sleeves shirt given me the bad attitude looking at me saying the food is preparing. Yet coming late customer can get the dessert before us.The dinner sessions is totally a disastrous to me as my mum is not happy on that day. I feel that the restaurant senior staff not fully coordinating well enough and the bad attitude from your staff also given me chances that will be the last that I come to Millenia outlet. Is not worth paying the service charge to the restaurant after the elemen restaurant have been recently well known. Service and food is getting worst than better

This is one of the best vegetarian restaurant I have been to. The presentation was exciting, food tasted excellent and definitely is value for money. The elemen Appetiser was marvellous. The Quinoa salad was great. The Double-boiled Maca Soup was not only delicious but also has anti-aging properties. The Tempura Tofu with Avocadol Roll was tasty. The Double-boiled Lemongrass with Peach Gum was light an soothing for the stomach. Its definitely a wonderful and fulfilling lunch

Saturday lunch is popular at Elemen but when we commenced dining around 1.35 pm, there were some empty tables. When I asked about my reservation, the female staff could not get my name right. My friend had arrived before me, and no explanation was given to her or to us about how to use the tablet for ordering. A male staffer took our order. We had to order 8 courses, as the 5-course sets were not available. 8 courses include drinks. Japanese, Chinese, Italian and other influences are apparent in a carefully-thought-out menu.That said, some advice on the mains would have been appreciated, because my friend ordered a pizza she could not finish, unless I ate 2 slices. I hope this lack of spontaneous service does not extend to those customers who are more conscious about not having any animal products eg dairy in their choices, when they ask. The breadsticks with a pink yoghurt dip was an unmemorable course to start with, but the breadsticks were good for mopping up the sauces of the appetiser. The second course consisted of an appetiser with 3 items: Mushrooms with edamame, black sesame tofu with alfafa sprouts in a creamy sesame dressing, and the chilled cherry tomato was a good start. Before we had finished half of our second course, the salads were served. Since Elemen has had at least 2 years to refine their approach, this rush of service and lack of consideration for the diners was not appreciated, and I told the waitstaff doing the serving to please slow down the speed of bringing out courses. The spinach salad in a sesame-teriyaki sauce was very good. The double-boiled Burdock roots with monk fruits was delicious. The wild mushroom cream soup with truffle oil was average. Another server advised my friend to roll up the arugula leaves inside her wild mushroom and white truffle pizza instead of eating it American-style, and doing so was delicious. The salted egg pasta was well-executed. Tagliatelle was al dente and sauce being flavourful but not thick, overly rich or cloying, this main was enjoyably easy to finish, filling without being heavy or nauseating. Dessert was a let-down and once again, served before my friend finished her pizza main. The coconut-infused jelly with watermelon sorbet did not complement each other. The snow osmanthus with grass jelly was refreshing but beyond that, not memorable. The apple and kale juice was good, and so was the yuzu mint mojito, to cut through the richness of the pizza. For $32.80, it would be worth it if all the courses were good, and the dip for the bread is altered and improved. At this point, in terms of value, I would prefer 5 courses, not 8. So much careful detail has been successfully exercised and appreciated, be it the preparation of food, presentation of food, and lay-out of the restaurant. However, some improvements are necessary. It is a pity about the service, which gets 2 stars. That said, I would return to try other items. I have hope that with the necessary improvements, this restaurant will be around for many years

Pleasantly surprised to have found this restaurant at Millenial Walk. Good choices of vegetarian food offering ala carte as well as 5 to 8 courses meal. Food styles are Taiwanese/Japanese fusion, I find they use truffles in some of their menu which gives vegetarian options another good lift. Very good pizza too. Service is good and would love to come back again for the 5 course meal. Highly recommended to vegetarian.

Was introduced to this vege outlet by a friend. Simply amazing.Not the normal local fare. There is something for everyone, Japanese, a bit of Korean, Italian and what have you....Going to share on two items - there are lots more ... when I have the time.1 Sea Salt Coffee - not for people who prefer things sweet. Pleasant surprise .. salty coffee.. salty and bitter... but to me just right. Some like to stir to have the whole flavor while others, just drink it as it is... the foam follow by the coffee itself (said to be not to bitter). I prefer to stir, salty and bitter.2 Pizza - not the normal cheesy pizza but paper thin pizzas. They just changed the menu and now comes with a charcoal pizza (black in color). Comes in app 12 inch size. Understand their food only uses Olive oil and no MSG, also does not use vege artificial ingredients. Uses mushrooms and truffle oil though not many people like the truffle smell.A small joke.. I brought my friends to have lunch at the Thomson outlet.. some of them took me aside and said, should we leave, I smell leaking gas... ha ha ... that is the truffle smell for the uninitiated. Overall experience... good

We reached restaurant around 9.30 and were asked to place order within 2 mins since the restaurant was about to close. We placed the order within 2 mins. However they started bringing the first 4 dishes of 8-course meal AND the bill all together without any sensitivity for guest's speed etc. Thumbs down

The restaurant venue is bright, trendy and sophisticated amongst most of its peers in prime locations.As casual gourmets looking for something new, the set menu stays almost unchanged.Most outstanding are still the marvellous Tokyo's Ginza Japanese wild mushroom and cheese pizza with ingenious finger foods... With less than 20 small tables, the overstaffed service staff are less attentive and courteous, apparently without the confidence and smiles to go with such splendid cuisines! Truly, what a pity indeed!The price remains somewhat overpriced close to the tag of fine dining outlets close by

If you like good, healthy vegetarian food then you should visit this place. It has some amazing array of veg food options. Prices are on the higher side considering the portion size but still it is a worth try. Go for their 5-course meal. The restaurant closes by 9 so make sure you reach there by 8 pm for a comfortable dinner

Singapore is traditionally not recognized for quality, vegetarian cuisine, but, Elemen at Millenia Walk, accessible from the Esplanade or Promenade MRT stations, is an exception. While I usually do not elect set-menus, the five course set-menus at Elemen are more economical than a la carte ordering and you have a variety of options from which to choose. Take your time to browse through the enticing menu and if you would like a recommendation of new dishes, I highly recommend the combination of spinach salad, braised bailing mushroom with EE Fu Noodles, iced lychee green tea and raspberry desert. Remember to inform the waiter to slow down and pace the deliver yof the dishes and not rush the presentation of the dishes; if you prefer your drink with lunch or dinner, inform the waiter of your preference to avoid the drink being presented with dessert. The ambience reminds me of a spa, with glass windows providing natural light which makes for an excellent choice for business or personal meals where atmosphere is important. It is interesting to note that building the well-being of their customers through natural, good food and beverage recipes, is a guiding principle of Elemen

I have visited the Thomson plaza branch many times with nice experiences, but this is my first visit to this branch. There are new dishes introduced and the food still tastes as good with the 5-course set chosen at $23.80++.However what was sadly disappointing is the unprofessional service by the supervisor Peter Lee. We simply could not understand what and how we has upsetted him. Was it because we were 5 minutes earlier than opening time and requested him to let us in? Was it because we requested for sofa seats which he claimed were all reserved? These are trivial matters for him to treat us like nobody by totally ignoring us and kept serving others who arrived later. He definitely is in the wrong line with his sulky face and lacks the professionalism to handle customers with the right attitude

It's a vegetarian restaurant serving in fine dinning style. Had been to the place twice. Really change my perspective of vegetarian food. Very nice for friends to share the different dishes available. Have always ordered the set menu value for money to try out the starters and main course

I made a reservation prior to my 5th visit to this restaurant in millennium walk. Today, I arrived as the first customer and placed my order for a 8 course meal. 10 minutes another waitress came and said that my order didn't appear on their system. So she needs to retake my order.Thereafter, the restaurant started to flood with more the customers. It took them another 30 minutes to serve my drink and starter. After an hour of waiting, I felt puzzled that they started to serve other customer who came later than us. I asked the waiter what happened to our order and they came back apologised that something wrong with their computer system that my order didn't go through. I was still determined to wait for my food and didn't want to make a fuss over such matter. Another 30 min later, the supervisor came with the wrong dish and I began to feel upset. I told them I waited for almost 1 hour and 30 mins and they still came with the wrong order.He apologized and blamed it on the system again. But I replied that didn't your staff wrote my order even the system was down? He did apologize again but I didn't feel that he is sincere enough for their mistakes. After 2 hours of waiting, my food started to serve when the restaurant was extremely crowded even I was the first customer to arrive. Finally, he served us with my dessert with stain on the spoon. I was extremely upset and told my friend that I will never come back again because their service was extremely bad when they are crowded. I am suppose to enjoy my healthy meal but because of the lousy service which they keep blaming on their computer system. I swear that I will never come back again because of poor service

Similar concept as SuFood but food is so much better. The dipping for break stick is yummy, so does the little tomato on the entree. Mushroom soup with truffle oil is amazing. The serving size for each dish is not big, but the main dish serving size is ok. Anyway, but the time you get to the last dish, you will be filled up! After the dinner, head out towards the Conrad hotel direction and you will see lots of Ferrari, Lumborgini, etc parking outside.

The food is plesant but the portions very small for two guys. Huge plate small portion. Better than sufood. Will need try the set meal.
4
The quinoa and brown rice hot stone pot was delicious! The 5-item menu is a good value for money. Desserts are not bad. The lava cake with the crumble is not too sweet.
5
The ambiance is great, the service is swift. We tried the following dishes - Edamane Tofu with Black Truffle Wild rice; Sizzling Quinoa brown rice; Apple Kale Juice. The proportion of food is just about right.
5
The restaurant is very clean, more contemporary decorated, service were excellent, good variety choice, if you need help in deciding what to order, the manager will be very willing to explain, describe and recommend what to order. Not disappointing at all, excellent taste and presentation. I highly recommend this restaurant

I had the 5 course set lunch. I don't normally like vegetarian food as they have a lot of "mock" items. This one is a fusion and uses lots of natural products. Comes w a starter which you cannot choose, followed by a salad or soup if your choice. For the main you can have pizza , pasta or rice. You can also choose your desserts and for drinks there is a variety for you to choose from hot and cold drinks. I had the cream of mushroom w truffle oil, followed by the rice and Quinoa. For drinks I had the lemongrass latte. I find for ladies the 5 course set is just nice. Perhaps for guys they can attempt the 8 course set at $39.90. OCBC cards get 10% off

I choose Elemen as the restaurant for my final night in Singapore. Many of my ex pat friends recommended it especially the sushi and the pizza. My advice is to book ahead. It was very popular and the food looked delicious. Unfortunately I couldn't get a seat so I will try again next time I visit Asia. Have a plan B if you can't get a seat as the front of house lady couldn't suggest any other vegetarian restaurants nearby and I had no data or wifi. Staff Could be friendlier

We had lunch at Elemen this summer. We had the 8 course dinner. The food is fresh and very tasty. My husband didn't even know realize it was vegetarian. Very nice manager, who coincidentally lived in the Netherlands as well and offered to show us around. We had a great lunch at Elemen and would certainly recommend this restaurant!
5
Overall, I love all the food we had ordered. My personal favorite is the Truffle Mushroom Soup. The richness of truffle in the thick soup. It's just awesome.Next in line, is the Truffle mushroom pizza. Definitely something I will go back for more.For the healthy drink, I highly recommend the Kale blended juice. It may look unappealing, but it's really nice.Will be back again

I was introduced to this restaurant as one serving fusion vegetarian fare. I chose the 5 course set lunch priced at S$23.50 and we got a good selection of items for each course. All dishes were excellent and tasty and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, regardless of vegan or carnivorou

I was blown away by the food served here. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of vegetarian cuisine. I don't like the fact that most typical vegetarian food is just nothing but flour. But here at Elemen, it's totally different! They infused the various dishes with lots of different vegetables n fruits! I love the tomatoes served as the starter. Being a huge truffle fan, the mushroom soup was super yummy! Go, treat urself to a great vegetarian experience!

Great choice of food available. Always had an idea that vegetarian food is all gluten but this place throws that idea out. Really tasty food that you will not miss meat when you are eating.

Smart place with smart staff a d very smart menu.
The menu and the details excite curiosity and deliver exceptionally on 'smart', 'creative', 'new and never before'.

I've been to this restaurant several times with my colleagues and was looking forward to bring my family there for a meal. We managed to make a trip last Wednesday. The staffs were friendly and professional as usual, patiently explaning some food to my mum and son. My teenage son loved the mushroom soup and the pizza. Mum enjoyed the more traditional and Chinese style cuisine. Overall they were impressed with the place and we'll definitely be back for more.

We have been vegetarians since the 80s and this is the very first time to encounter a sophisticated fusion vegetarian outlet to our hearts' delight !Even the renown decade-old Zen Japanese vegetarian outlet at Waterloo Street has little to match in terms of customer service and quality of food and presentation, needless to mention Elemen's apex Millennia Walk location.Pamper yourself with its wild mushroom cheesy pizza one fine day for early lunch and you will sure come back for more..

Staff is very welcoming especially Peter who was very patient and took the time to introduce May's dish for the month and recommend the all time favorites. He even coordinated a simple birthday celebration for my family member. Excellent customer service is the backbone of Elemen. Food items we tried and ratedMaca soup -7/10Mushroom salad - 6.5/10Wild mushroom cream soup - 8/10Braised golden brown pumpkin with Glutinious rice - 6.5/10Brown rice with grilled egg plant - 7/10Truffle oil mushroom pasta - 8/10 (can be less oily)Japanese curry noodles - 7/10Sweet potato puree - 5/10 (too diluted)Chocolate lava cake - 8/10 (good choice!

Extremely rare to find pure vegetarian places in singapore. And as much as I tried , I couldn't find a single flaw in any dish!We ate a five course meal priced at about 24$. And the portions were really generous! I don't understand how they could give you so much value in a country where everything else is so overpriced!Starting with an appetiser , chosen by them.You have a choice between a soup and a saladYou have to choose one main course, one dessert and one drinkAnd the choices are so incredibly vast, it amazes me!An absolute delight! Great service by Peter Lee who waited at our tables

The restaurant serves vegetarian food only. The courses of the served 5 or 8 course menue can be selected from the regular card. A good variation of different dishes makes it even for a non vegetarians like me easy to find tasty, high quality dishes. The price level is compared to other restaurants in this surrounding on a medium level but absolutely fair with respect to the quality

My friends and I decided to try this place. Vegetarian, but the menu does not "feel" that you are not getting any meat or insufficient protein. There's cheese and other dairy products in the menu, so if you are vegan, you may not like this place. But, there are dishes that are solely vegetable-based.The salted egg yolk pasta was pleasant. The portion looked small, but there was actually quite a bit of pasta in there. More salted egg yolk would have been nice. After a while, I felt I was eating plain spaghetti. Also very few mushrooms.The tomato mozzarella pizza was very nice. Thin crust pizza oozing with cheese. That was a good choice.The sushi was good too. With strawberries on top. The fried tofu was excellent!The chocolate lava cake was very good. Rich, but this dessert is rich anyway. The ice cream was very good.Coconut puree was nothing to shout about. We ordered it because the waiter said it had collagen. Overall, this place is decent for the price and ambience. I would go back again to try other dishes

I've heard so much about this vegetarian restaurant and have been wanting to try it. So glad my good friend was free to join me for lunch today. The staff was very friendly and helpful in recommending and introducing the dishes as it's my 1st visit. I love the variety and taste of each dish. Would definitely recommend anyone who scorn vegetarian food to give elemen a try
