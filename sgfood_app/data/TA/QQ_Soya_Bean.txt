QQ originated from the Old Airport Hawker store. In its heydays daily sale was in the thousands. Only regular customers and residents in the neighbourhood know its existence now. Assorted flavour - black bean soya, almond, durian, chocolate. At 1.20 for the plain version, it's inexpensive. Unforunately for visitors to venture out here, which is almost 750 metres from Kembangan MRT and Eunos MRT, the unit price goes up. Non-additives and made from limited use of machinery, it is tastier than the soya bean from Shanghai but less sweet than those in Taiwan or Korea. Hope the owners can reinvent their business, greater use of social media and research into wider product versions. For savouring one-off traditional soya bean curd & drink, it may be worth a visit for curiosity
