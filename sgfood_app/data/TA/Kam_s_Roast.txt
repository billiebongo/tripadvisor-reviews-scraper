Michelin star from HK and Macau.
The King of Roast if you ask me!
Food was very good. Extensive menu and good service.

Not a char siu & siu yok person but Kam's Roast just made me love to eat char siu& siu yok! It's delicious!
4
Worthy of its Michelin Star. The roast duck was nice but I particularly enjoyed the suckling pig, which you have to order in advance.
5
From Alan‚Äôs friendly welcome, to the delicious food, to the efficient service this was a real treat. This bustling Orchard Road Restaurant gets it right!
5
It was a stormy night in Singapore and we went to Kam's Roast. We had the pork and the duck. It was great! Our waiter Alan was awesome.
5
Taken by a local friend, who ordered for us. Everything was fantastic, roast duck was divine, roast suckling pig delicious and the spare ribs although being almost impossible for us to eat with our basic chop stick skills, were very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyed, we went early to beat the dinner rush

Normally, I prefer good efficient service in any restaurant but my lunch experience at Kam's Roast Singapore was extremely rushed and really didn't enjoy the meal as much as I would have anticipated. I understand the Hong Kong style service is one of swift and speed; but when overdone, guests are rushed into gobbling up the meal. The food all came very quickly and the staff started removing dishes even when we weren't quite done yet. We recommend to train the staff to pace the flow of food and clearing process. While the duck was excellent, the veges were some what overdone and wonton noodles soggy. The iberico BBQ was not as good as some other Chinese restaurants near by. Questionable this is Michelin worthy.
1
Because of the minimum order imposed on table that is reserved via Chope ($30 per pax), the person who took our order keep reminding us how much more we need to order to hit the minimum. I expect staff from a Michelin star restaurant to be more polite and tactful. Also drinks are not counted in the minimum. The restaurant was not even half filled during lunch time thus it is better to just walk in.
4
Wonderfully sinful fat char siew , BBQ to perfection, absolutely delicious to taste and melts in mouth.did not have chance to eat their famous goose , so had to settle for the fat BBQ pork.Roast chicken and duck not bad but cannot compare to their goose in HK and this TORO char siew
3
We were keen to try the pecking duck and ended up here. The server was on point and really great, even joked with us.The food was ok but in my opinion was nothing worthwhile for me to problem, besides the fact that I do not enjoy duck that much
2
We were greeted with under the escalator kind of shop front, ambience was coffee shop like-environment, service average. It‚Äôs the food which is super expensive given that serving and taste, not fantastic at all. Thumb down!
1
Not good at all; drinks are disgusting..
Roast ok but just average.
Not recommended,much better options for the price., Michelin?
5
Nice ambience, waiters/waitress were very polite. Good recommendation & not pushy Yummy food especially roasted ducküòÄ will come back again
5
We had dinner with parents and kids. We all liked the food here. Soya chicken is very tender and roast duck is delicious!
4
Iberico char siew, roast duck & roast pork are must-haves. Along with red bean soup with orange peel for dessert.A meal of honest decadence agreed by the happy faces we see in the buzzing business all around us.Simple, good service.Not the cheapest roast meat meal in Singapore for sure, but one worth a visit
1
Overrated and the worse roasted ever in singapore. The waitress who took order was polite but with oilment smell. We didnt even finish the raosted duck, toro char siew and roasted pork tat we ordered. Seriously its far away from michelin standard! Dont waste money and time!
3
We have read great reviews about Kam's Roast so decided to eat here on a recent trip to Singapore. The food is pricey and the service was not great. Our rice dish was served 15 minutes before our main meal and when the meal arrived, the rice dish had obviously gone cold. Apparently Kam‚Äôs Roast Goose in Hong Kong was awarded the Michelin star for 3 consecutive years and they promote this at Kam's in Singapore. However, this Restaurant is not at this level yet...
5
Unassuming place but the food is good. Had the whole duck and it was very well roasted. Meat was succulent and tender. Iberico pork was also very well marinated and the meat was tender and melts in your mouth.Would recommend this place for lunch and dinner for small groups.Price is reasonable too
5
I eat noodles with BBQ pork and roast pork for comfort. In fact, noodles of any kind. It's a food that is very easy to eat; it's very soothing and comfortable, too. If I could choose any, I'd say this noodle is my favourite: it has a very good flavour and is healthy, too. Yummy
4
We ordered wanton noddles, roasted duck (1/2), and a Toro Char Siew & Roasted PorkÂèåÊãº. The roasted duck, char siew and roasted pork are tender. Really like the sweet plum sauce, goes well with the roasted duck and char siew. The wasabi/ mustard sauce goes unexpectedly well with the roasted pork. Wanton noodles are springy, but taste bland if u dun add chilli to it. Service is prompt and excellent. Overall it's worth eating, slightly burning the pocket
4
How can you go wrong if Michelin gives it 1 star in HongKong and they are now in Singapore?
The roasted meats and duck are specialties. However, their real specialty of roast goose is not available in Singapore.
Still worth a try!
5
We're here for the first time and our server gives us good recommendations on what to order. Food is delicious and service is great. Will definitely be back again to try other dishes on menu.
4
Staff helpful & friendly and the meal very tasty. Decor simple and clean. Location just off the popular Orchard road.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the succulent Roast Duck and Roast meats. Simple meal with family members, good and attentive service. Patrons - remember to make a reservation .
5
Should try this when in Singapore!! Love the roast duck & Toro char Siew! There's iberico char Siew which is special and nice.
4
Very good food. I had the char siu pork. Great flavor, sweet without being too sweet. Wife had the wonton noodle soup we shared the roast duck. Her soup broth was very rich and tasty. Roast duck was awesome. Nice braising sauce, and just the right thickness of fat. We will be returning to eat here again.
4
I've never tried Kam's Roast in HK before but have heard of their roast goose which earned them 1 Michelin star. Unfortunately, the particular breed used is not allowed in Singapore and so the Singapore franchise has to make do with duck. But it's still good. Very succulent and soft, they've really nailed down their technique. Prices are a little high considering you can probably get the same thing in a hawker centre for half the price but I'll give it to them since their quality is really not bad at all
5
Every time I visit Singapore, Kam‚Äôs Roast is on my ‚Äòmust go to‚Äô list. Last weekend, I got there 20 minutes before it shut - just in time! My friend and I enjoyed the Cha Siu and Roast Pork - the only two types of meat left for the day, as they sell out fast - as well as some vegetables and noodles. The meat was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of fat, crispy crackling and delicious sauces (mustard, chilli).The staff are all lovely, recognise me from previous visits and even get my sense of humour now! Thanks Kam‚Äôs team for great food and enjoyable dining experiences in 2017. See you again in 2018

For some strange reason, TripAdvisor‚Äôs 3 Stars means Average and 4 Stars means Very Good. What happened to Good? In this case, I would give it3.5 Stars.Bought this back for lunch with my aunt and uncle.Staff were friendly. Service was good although it was just for takeaway.The cashier tried to push the more expensive items like Ib√©rico char siew and pipa duck. Roast duck was very good. Tender even though the slices of breast meat were kind of thick.Char siew (usual meat, not fancy, fancy costs about twice as much) was okay. Nothing spectacular.Roast pork (3-layered) - good but not the best I‚Äôve ever had.Do they deserve their Michelin Star? I‚Äôm undecided at this moment
1
Overrated! Expensive! Poor Service!!!It is a far cry from the one in HK, the HK 's Kam with the goose, and nowhere near the standard of equivalent in HK. Their roast duck is more or less the same standard from any neighborhood wet market but at a fraction of the price.So much hype but the outcome was terribly disappointing. Because of the hype, we had dinner at the restaurant on a Saturday evening and there was no queue. The meats were nice but so are those from many of the roast meats stalls/restaurants in Singapore (and at a fraction of the price!). Interesting to understand how these Michelin inspectors dish out the stars. If this place can get a Michelin star, then many of the stalls/restaurants in Singapore deserve one too. The restaurant is cramped, staff very busy, so the poor service is perhaps expected.The quality is certainly not what one would expect from a One Star Michelin. The noodles were sloppy. Other roast places in Singapore hawker centers would have provided better food. The quality of the food is average.. we have tried better duck and pork elsewhere.. for the price there are high end Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasures.. If this is a higher end and more classy restaurant, like the Imperial Palace, one would be able to appreciate the prices better. The restaurant however looked more like a food court, the pricing really looks crazy. The ambience is nothing to crow about, and there are many Cantonese restaurants along Orchard Road that provide a much better ambience.We did a re-take, in considering a take away of the roast duck or char siew, as it was not worth the money nor the waiting time. Many local roast meat joints and hawker centers in Singapore serve much better roast meat than Kam's. A huge disappointment. Undeserving of Michelin Star.Not recommended for the food, service, price and ambience.. First and last time..

Excellent place for hong kong style roast meat! thumb up for this Michelin Restaurant and for sure I will come back again
5
Ordered the Kam‚Äôs Four Treasure Rice! Loved how the different combination were put together to allow us to try the different type of meat without having to over eat!
Would loved to come back again to try other dishes
5
Very delicious . Worth the visit. Taste as good as goose that we tried in hong kong. Will return to eat again.
5
Food is really delicious and yummy. The famous roast duck never fails us. It is succulent and juicy. The Toro char siew is very good too
5
Delicious food! The five of us finished one whole roast duck, two types of BBQ pork, rice, noodles and vegetables. The meat was juicy and succulent üëåüèΩ. Will definitely come back again
5
Simple restaurant that serve great Hong Kong food
Wonderful Rost duck
Perfect wanton noodles
Very efficient and convivial service
Reasonable prices
4
Meat was really average. Duck was ok. Crispy roast meat was the pretty good. Food was too cold for my taste.
1
it is a disappointment and overly charged! 2 adult and 2 kid cost us $99 for a meal. We ordered 3 kind meat and 3 cold vegie. It is only so-so. I still prefer the one we had in Hong Kong! Will not visit again on ow
5
We needed a quick lunch before going to the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday 17 September and visited Kam's Roast which was next door to our hotel, Royal Plaza on Scott's. We were delighted with our delicious meal, the quick service and the friendliness of the management. Definitely somewhere to go both for a quick visit, and a longer one
4
We were regulars at their original restaurant in Hong Kong and after moving back to Singapore, was told they have a branch here!The big difference here is that they don't serve goose and in place, duck instead...Alan, recommended both their signature "Lo Sui" duck and Michellin Star roast duck as well as the toro char siew...They were absolutely delicious!Although they replace the goose for duck, they tasted almost the same! The toro char siew (marinated with honey) was by far one of the best I have tasted!Service was not only professional, Alan and team were very attentive and prompt in getting orders and packing the leftovers...Glad we don't have to fly to Hong Kong now (except of course if goose is still your preferred choice)
5
I tried this at Hong Kong every time I visited to Hong Kong. And I cannot believe that Singapore open the other outlet. The taste was fantastic and the place was comfortable compare to Hong Kong. Will come back again next time
5
Best roast by far ... value for money ... fast service ...
Roast pork is crispy, soup is heavenly, red bean soup desert is superb.
5
Best roastedpork ever
Service is fast and best value
Just beside THW. Will surely comeback for more.
3
food and service are ok. However, after eating, you can have headache and thirsty due to overdose of MSG in the source and the BBQ pork. May be the soup too. Tried it twice and both time have the MSG overdose effects
5
Great roast pork and char siu had to compete with 5 other family members to get some to taste- very enjoyable
1
I ate Kam's in Hong Kong which was absolutely great on every visit I go. The Singapore outlet only carries the name but not the taste. Food for the Singapore outlet is horrible. You can get better standard of food in small stalls around Singapore.
4
Dinner at Kam's Roast last night. Went there at nearly 9pm so it was pretty empty by then. How do I rate it vis-a-vis the one in HK? It's been well documented that this SGP offshoot does not serve goose, so a like-for-like comparison is not possible. That said, the duck is roasted to perfection, in the same manner as the one in HK, but the flavour is less intense than goose. The toro char siu is excellent, though wifey was somewhat put off by the fatty bits. The crispy roast pork is a real treat; pieces of pork with the right fat/lean meat ratio, crowned by perfect pork skin crackling
4
The location is good for meeting lunch Kaki and friend and family to gather for a good meal. The Roast Duck skin is crispy and sour plum sauce is nice. The roast meat is well cook serve with nice mustard source. The ambience is good . Finally the lotus soup Is also tasted nice. The Pamelo tea serve in hot or cold is good too. Lastly the dry soya source chicken noodle served is soft and tender
4
We arrived at 1230pm and were surprised that there was no crowd on Sunday afternoon. Overall the food was up to expectation though not Wow. The suckling pig was pricy but the duck was good value taking into consideration of the location of the restaurant and service. We will definitely return for future Sunday lunch.

This restaurant definitely does not deserve a Michelin Star. I think when it was being assessed the chef gave the assessors the best quality meat and roast etc. But when we normal patrons come in to eat. It is so pedestrian and even worse. The food has no taste! It is heavily watered down. The sauce is minuscule and stingy. The portion sizes are for kids. The chicken had no taste. Bland and boring to say the least. The pork crackling was not crackling. More like soft chewy piece of leather. The pork quality was disgusting and fatty and no meat. The duck was tough, tasteless, not crispy and disgusting. The vegetables oily and watered down soy sauce. The price was damn expensive. I am Asian and I am well travelled tasting, eating and sampling Asian cuisine across all the Asian countries and as well as Europe and UK. So I know what I am eating and reviewing. Not deserving of the Michelin Star. I have eaten better roast meat from hawker stalls or from food centres. Very disappointed. Dunno what the hype is about. I think the Michelin Star assessors should eat there one time unannounced and pretend to be just a regular customer. See the difference in quality, taste and texture
4
Really enjoyed an evening out with family here. The food was good - authentic Hong Kong. Service was good and very accommodating to the kids. Really recommend for a casual evening meal. Nothing fancy but relaxed with good food
5
The roast duck & roast pork are great. We will definitely come back. Tried the vegetable noodles in soup and they are awesome.
2
Service was bad, cocky in fact. Food quality is not up to the mark. Soup was not hot. Ordered duck, roast pork and char siew. Had better ones elsewhere, which were cheaper and better.
5
The signature roast duck are very succulent and the honey roast char Siew are very lean and done to perfection! Even the hot barley water are nice..
5
The food was awesome! You should try the duck and the noodles with the ginger for sure! The staff was really friendly and helpful with us. I definately recommend it...!!!
4
Had dinner here with my family. They have a new item - iberico honey char siew. Also had the marinated duck and noodles. We enjoyed the iberico honey char siew. The duck was so-so. Noodles was unique and tasted very good. The dining atmosphere was alright. Service was excellent
3
This is the first visit to Kam's Roast Singapore with my family. Naturally I will compare the overall standard against Yung Kee in Hong Kong which it is a must visit restaurant whenever I am in Hong Kong. Without doubt, Yung Kee is a clear winner in all aspects. I think goose roast by Yung Kee is much better than duck roast by Kam, with a more delicious taste and crispy goose skin. Yung Kee provide casual and also formal dining to suit all occasion. I hope Kam's roast duck should put in more effort to upgrade to the same level of Yung Kee
3
Wanted to try out the famous Kams. Was planning to order a simple duck on noodles but realized they only do that from 11-5pm. At other times you have to order the meats separately from the rice or noodles. So $6.8 for decidedly bland noodles or $8.8 for 4 wantons more. For roast duck - you can't order it combined with other roasted meats. Starts from $16.80 for a 1/4. The lower half. The upper half will cost you $19.80 instead. A bit too calculative for my liking. The roasted pork, chicken and char siew can be mixed. Ordered the Toro char siew and roasted pork. I must say the char siew was amazing with lots far and sweet sauce. The roast pork was average for me. Overall, I feel that the restaurant is trying really hard to charge as much as it can by imposing various restrictions. Even though the char siew was nice I don't really like to be coerced into ordering in a certain way. Try once just for the sake of it. Then never come back. Preferably when it's 11-5pm.
4
I was craving for Kam's goose,the tasty tender goose in Hong Kong. I am so glad that I found one in Singapore Orchard. Kam still served quality goose in Singapore and the service of the staff make it a cozy meal to have.I will come back again for the goose and other food like roasted pork and vegetable. and the nooldes!

This was a special lunch treat for a dear relative. And I raved how good this place was (after watching some review on TV) and how I wanted to bring him here to try. This is the 1st mistake I made.2n midstake was to book online when per head count had a minimum expenditure of SGD30. And a deposit of SGD20 per pax need to paid during reservation. This is not applicable for walk in. There was plenty of seats left when we arrived for lunch.Call me kampong or sua ku. I didn't know what they had on the menu. Captain attended to us was not so friendly and in fact a little cocky. I can be one too. In short, because we needed to spend minimum 120 dollars, we took some time to order and with the "helpful", it was a tedious journey. Food review1 Signature duck half portion - nothing to brag about. I have eaten better ones. 2 Toro special char Siew and roast pork. Char Siew was good. Fatty parts didn't feel oily at all. Roast pork there is nothing so special about it3 Daily soup. Not hot at all. Lukewarm. Taste hmmm have better ones elsewhere at that price4 Duck web. So so5 Cold dish of black fungus w vinegar. So so6 Cold dish of cucumber w vinegar. Not bad.7 Cured liver sausage. Ok la8 Marinated tofu. Why did I even order ttOverall, for sure not worth paying the price. Maybe this is more suitable for HKer's taste.A big thank you to the waitress who asked questions and recommended a good take away option (our eat in order was $10 shorts or so from $120).I felt lucky tt I came with my family and not clients.This is a first and last visit
5
Tasty juicy duck with awesome service. Attentive to details and very helpful. Will recommend if you like to have good duck in Orchard
4
Very tasty and succelent roasted goose, suckling pigs, bbq pork and soya chicken. Ginger and onion oil compliments the dishes even better. Pricey but worthy. It carries michelin star.
3
An extension of 1 star michelin from HK, however, we can't get the goose here in Singapore. Roast pork, duck, and other dishes is so-so, on average. Price is so-so also.. Nothing memorable
5
The roastedduck is yummy. The duck's texture is good. The service is exellence. I am recommend to my friend
5
The best roasted duck ever. So delicious. Went with family and we are so satisfied with the food and service. Will come back for sure.
5
It is the best duck meal i ever had in singapore. The service is excellence. I recommend this restaurants.
3
Admittedly the roast duck was tender and tasty but the slices were too thick. The char siew and the roast pork were very fatty and oily and were not served hot. The same applied to the noodles which were barely warm when served. Moreover the noodles had been over cooked.The service was attentive and the decor is pleasant.The prices are on the high side and all in all you get a much better deal at Imperial Treasure for this type of fare
4
We were a group of 7 and were at the restaurant half an hour early (2 pax were running late) but the manager very kindly invited us to get seated inside so we could order some drinks at least. Considering the restaurant was getting full with patrons, we were surprised they allowed us to get a table first. They gave us a table in the private dining room which was really nice and private. The suckling pig is a must-order. One of the best I've had in Singapore! The meat was tender and the skin was really crispy. A bit pricey, but worth a try. The torro char siew, which is their signature, is also a must-order. Best char siew I've had. Love it that they use the fatty meat. Very different from the local char siew u get at hawker centres. Everything else was good but not to die for
3
Dinner with a friend after a movie. Tried all the meat they were supposed to be famous for. The Michelin star was a draw. Roast duckVery good but not spectacular. Could be juicer. Skin was pretty crispy but alas not mind blowing. Texture and experience of the meat could have been better. Perhaps because we came at the end of the day. 8/10Roast porkCrispy. Good. But not perfect. Lacking in flavour, a tad more salt would have taken it up a notch. Not as juicy and succulent as it could be. Perhaps they could have a better supplier. Have had better on the street in Muar and Penang and even Johor Town. 6.5/10Char siewExcellent. Perfect dance of fat, meat, juice and char. And the number they do on your tongue, just fabulous. This was a superior experience. 9.5/10NoodlesGreat texture and taste. Bouncy yet supple, firm yet not overly chewy. Absorbed the flavours well. 8.5/10SoupFree soup came with the noodles. It had great taste but was too salty. Prices were a bit steep. Meat and noodles for 2 came up to about s$70. No drinks just s$0.60 ice water. Yes they charge for ice water. In my humble opinion not worth the price. You can find as good options or better, at lower prices elsewhere on the island and even in Malaysia. They get three stars because of the exorbitant prices they're charging for what is essentially street food. If you really must eat at this Michelin starred then go for the char siew and noodles.
5
Recently ordered take away for the family after a long day seeing the sights and not wanting to sit through a full on restaurant experience. Very welcoming front counter staff, easy menu options and the service assisted me in ordering the roast duck, char siew and the roasted pork belly along with some stir fried greens. The flavours were superb and the meat cooked beautifully tender. I little gem of a restaurant, easy to find on the ground floor ( look form the big sign out front near the entry doors. Very happy with our meal
5
The roast skin of the roast duck is crispy n the meat is tender. The roast char siew
Is very juicy. Also ordered soya sauce chicken
5
Food was excellent. Ordered double duck combination (roast and braised). The duck was nicely roasted and braised. Also ordered the roasted toro pork (chat Siew). Absolutely yummy. Kids also love the soya sauce chicken. Family thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience.
5
Ate here with family. The ducks were good! Will be back again for more! Reasonable prices. Consider the marinated duck!
5
Celebrate Happy Father's Day at Kam's Roast. Best Roasts in Singapore! Love the ducks, char siu, crispy roast pork, etc ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Roast duck and Suckling Pig is worth the trip.
Eat the duck with its dripping.
The soy chicken is very tender, make sure to eat with the spring onion ginger sauce.
4
We got takeaways of cuttlefish amongst other scrummy food aand would highly recommend the food here. Best tofu I've ever eaten.
4
Had the taro char Siew and fall in love with it immediately. Definitely a mid week dinner treat to our tummy for me and my friends. Saw the lunch set menu and looking forward to try it, with reasonable pricing.
4
I wanted a nice Asian meal after 2 weeks spent in Australia, so decided since I was in the vicinity to have my lunch there. I've been there before but this time because I took my time to enjoy my meal, I found it absolutely satisfying. The noodles were done just right, springy without being too al dente. The roast pork was crispy, succulent and simply delicious. I also had the Char Siew (barbecue pork) which was good, but I would have preferred a little more fat n slightly charred. Otherwise it was a lovely meal.
5
Came here for fathers day lunch and had a private room to ourselves. Love the marinated side dishes!! The cuttlefish, black fungus and cucumber are SOO GOOD. My dad who is very particular about roast duck said its gd n the sauce has a special taste. Will recommend to friends!
3
Was excited to try the HK famous Michelin Star roast duck at Pacific Plaza. Wasn't that crowded on a Friday night and we managed to get seats for our group. We ordered the whole duck, special char siew and roast pork and some noodles. The roast meat was quite ordinary and I ve in fact eaten much better version at the foodcourt just opposite the mall. The roast pork is not average as well. The special pork is slightly better but if I have to compare it to Fung Kee at Chinatown or KayLee at Suntec, it's a little normal. Overall average but not great considering it won the Michelin Star for 3 years (2015 - 2017), maybe it's the one from HK n not here in singapore.
4
Had a lovely meal at the Michelin Star Kam's in Scotts Road. Prices were reasonable. The duck was so so
4
Great roast meats, comfortable setting, good service staff, easily accessible. Would come back again!
5
Best duck in Singapore . Love it . Good service good food good price . Feels like eating in Hong Kong
4
Don't really understand the "Michelin star" hype as its a basic noodle eatery, nothing fancy. The noodles were ok but the duck was tasty and tender
4
A little bit pricey but the food is really yummy. I ordered the roast duck, pork and cha siew. Love their honey and date tea.
3
Goose restaurant that doesn't serve goose! Had the duck&charsiew, duck wasn't crunchy and was way too fatty for me but the charsiew was great. Had to share a table and paid about 17$ which I felt was mostly going towards rent and the Michelin star than the food..
4
We stop by when we're in town since we're just across the street. First tried them when they opened last year. The roast duck had a very clean taste and both the duck jus as well as the citrus sauce (with a hint of salted plum) went really well with it. This justified the high price considering every food centre in Singapore has a roast duck stand. The first time we ordered it, it felt like they gave us more breast meat and less dark/leg meat), but we enjoyed the succulent duck which is why we've been coming back. The roast suckling pig can be inconsistent at times - when you see it hanging on the display with a reddish hue, that's a safe bet that it will be proper Hongkong style with the unmistakable aroma and fragrant skin (sometimes the skin just looks plain brown which is another style). Service by the restaurant opening team is usually great. Recommende
4
Ordered the quarter duck - lower upper half as the lower half is sold out. The meat is hearty, not so oily unlike London Fat Duck. Pretty decent portion of noodles. The wanton soup is common, unlike the good wantons served in HK. Char Siew is charred but good flavour. Overall a great food experience. Location is under the escalator, not ideal but accessible
4
Located at Pacific Plaza next to Shaw Lido at Orchard road, we went there at 5.15pm for dinner before our 6.30 movie at Shaw Lido (no Q at 5.15). We ordered a ÂèâÁáí/Ê≤πÈõûÊãºÁõ§, 1/4 ÁîòÁâåÁáíÈ¥®, 1/4 Êª∑Ê∞¥È¥®, ÁáôÈùíËèú and ÈµùËÇùÈ¶ôËÖ∏„ÄÇ Our orders came to us very quickly and all in one go. Personally I was very impressed with ÂèâÁáíË∑üÊ≤πÈõû„ÄÇ ÁáíÈ¥®&Êª∑Ê∞¥È¥® were nice but didn't exceed my expectations. We finished our dinner around 6.15 - just in time for our movie at Shaw Lido. By the time we were leaving, a small size crowd has formed in the Q outside the restaurant
5
I went back again and again to this place. The food was awesome, but the staff were what made it even better - really friendly and helpful (one of the young front of house guys in particular). I'm not a big eater, so had my usual - roast pork and soy chicken on rice. It was delicious! I always go early (before the 7pm+ madness), but you could also get takeaway and enjoy this back in your hotel room with a njce glass of wine and bad reality TV. Definitely worth going, if somewhat hidden up the top end of Orchard Road. Funnily enough, Tim Ho Wan is upstairs in the same building
4
This place is often busy, we just tried for lunch.. 68 SGD for 4, good price good food but nothing amazing
4
Typical local asian food at easy and informal high quality standards.. Roast is juicy, tasty and delicious. Prices are fine..
4
We celebrate Mum birthday lunch with grandpa. Nice Cantonese roasted meats, the toro char Siew was the favorite for the family. Would be even better if there are more vegetables varieties. üòã
5
Had this when we were at HongKong. Delighted to find this in Singapore. Went in for Roast Duck, but fell deeply in love with the toro char siu. Fatty delicious char siu is amazing and a MUST have. Apart from that the newly introduced marinated items on the menu are pretty good too. Especially the tofu!!!! Will be back for more
2
I don't think I am fussy or I have high expectations. But honestly speaking, nothing to rave about. The honey roast pork was not sweet neither did it taste like honey. We ordered the suckling pig which was a big big disappointment. It was like putting a piece of fat into my mouth. The roast pork was nowhere crispy nor seasoned enough. The soya chicken was not bad when dipped in the scallion sauce. Duck was a little too dry. Try it for yourself but this is a place I wouldn't recommend. Perhaps the one in hk is worth trying.
3
It was an underwhelming experience. Roast charsiew was dry and drowning in thick brown sauce. Roasted ribs had little meat coated with thick honey sauce. Vegetables were overly poached and soggy.Surprised to find out they were a michelin star restaurant! Their michelin star definitely did not make it to our shores. Even the roasted platter at East Ocean Teochew Restaurant tasted better. Unjustifiable prices. Would not return again.
5
Heard that the roast duck at the newly opened Kam's Roast is good and decided to check it out for lunch. I am not a duck lover but the roast duck IS really delicious. The duck is flavorful, lean and succulent. Hardly any fats on the underside of the skin. The duck sauce is not overpowering & goes very well with steamed rice. The premium BBQ Pork has too much fat/meat ration, not my favorite but it is tasty. The skin of the crispy roast pork is non oily and gives a crispy crunch. Overall, very happy with the food. The restaurant is usually very busy at lunch. I find the tables are a little too close, and seating a little tight. The service is very good, alert and quick.

Stumbled upon this place by accident - it is located on the bottom floor of an office building where I had a morning meeting. It's lovely window of roast ducks/geese was a welcoming sight. While I anticipated the meeting would go well, I knew that even if it didn't, I would leave the area happy after the prospect of lunch at this place.I was not disappointed, and neither will you be. About USD 14, tea and tip included

The Hong Kong Michelin starred Kam's Roast is in Singapore at Pacific Plaza next to Shaw Centre in the Orchard Road area. The shop has many kinds of excellent roast meats (except goose) - duck, crispy pork, toro char siew , suckling pig. The noodle was very good , el dente Hong Kong style.

To be fair, this is not HK 's Kam with the goose.Most of the local reviewers are generous to give this joint 2 stars and those from the US whom gave this joint 4 stars i don't fault you as the roast duck you get in chinatowns is no where near the standard expected by Hong kongers , malaysians and singaporeans whom will bench mark any roast with that they have from their home bases.If you want roast duck you can get more or less the same standard from any neighbourhood wet market ! if you don't know where to find some , go to Golden Shoe Philip St Raffles place you will find equivalent roast duck , char siew at $ 5 a plate vs $18 here. Don't think they will last once the hype is worn out if they depend on locals vs tourists ! same case with tian tian chicken rice which has a strong following amongst tourists because it s a ' must have ' but reality check you will not find any locals queuing up for Tian Tian chicken rice as there are better local versions Not saying the food is all that bad but rather for $18 for a duck and char siew rice, i m better off going to a non branded roast duck stall at a food court

The food is great and the service is good. It's a must to order of the ducks, Cha Siew and roast pork.

Enjoyed our 1/2 roast duck with the plum sauce. The duck was succulent and tasty. Nice fat.Also ordered the combination Chinese sausage. Disappointing.Tried the toro char siew. Lots of fat. The taste was good. Nicely done. Have to try but will not order again. A cholesterol hugging dish

Had dinner at the restaurant yesterday (Saturday evening). We were seated immediately (there was no queue). We ordered 1/4 roast duck and a combination of chicken and char siew. The meats were nice but so are those from many of the roast meats stalls/restaurants in Singapore (and at half the price!). I wonder who these Michelin inspectors were. If this place can get a Michelin star, then half the stalls/restaurants in Singapore deserve one too. Seats were uncomfortable and tables cramped close together (bags have to be placed on the floor under the table). The restaurant is designed to make you eat quickly and leave equally quickly so that more customers could be served. Staff were all very busy and harassed rushing from one end to another. Do not expect attentive service

I booked trough Chope and didn't go through term and condition . We dined 2 person and was forced to order a set menu . I will have to read carefully next time . Service was bad at first but later an experience staff served us when he saw we are not happy. Too much gravy in roast duck spoiled the taste.

Lunched there today as we'd heard so much about it but we were terribly disappointed. We had a quarter roasted duck, a quarter roasted soya chicken, a combination of toro charsiu, roasted pork and a portion of liver sausage and a small veg. The quality is certainly not what one would expect from a One Star Michelin. The noodles were not springy and what's worse they gave a sambal belachan which marred the taste of the roasts. The toro charsiu was far too fat and sweet! I think they need to go back to the drawing board. We paid $157! Not worth it. Other roast places in Singapore hawker centres would fare better!

Kam's roast supposedly to be very good in hong kong for their noodle, char siew duck etc. So when they open in singapore people are excited.Few friends had tried the food and give a thumb down.They had a promotion wth straits times on the 12/2/17 with newspaper cutting u get 1 for 1 high tea starting 2.30-5 pm Each set is $18.80Sound good enough reason for me to try out. There were long queue but they manage it quite well and most people can be seat and food was serve rather fast. Is more of a food court style rather than a restaurant.The sign board is bright from far quite impressive, but once inside the feeling is different. No atmosphere. People hurrying serving the set no conversation, no greeting is like you eat you go.The portion is rather small, I ask whether the serving is the same $18.80 per serving and the waitress said yes. If yes is not worth to eat at all.There are plenty of good char siew, roast duck, noodle at other restaurants even our hawker centre and price is cheaper.

We stayed at the Royal Plaza on Scotts and were looking for a Singaporean Dinner place! We found this place by accident. It is located next Door at Pacific Plaza Building!!!This is a small and friendly Restaurant with a excelent and easy menu selection of Chinese style roasts such as Goose and different Roast Pork varieties, we ordered the Goose and Crisp Pork with Noodles.I only can Say it was so very, very delicius and that We regret that we had to leave the next day and could not come for a second serving!!!Very friendly and helpful service!!!Highly recommended with

Never got a chance to visit their original restaurant in Hong Kong. Came across this branch in Singapore by chance and found seat, probably as it was before the rush lunch hour. Disappointed to find out that they indeed did not serve roasted goose here. Ordered their roasted duck (leg, added S$5) plus barbecue pork. Average, or slightly above average, quality but it is what I would have expected anyway, given the premium they are charging. To be honest, you can easily find better stores in popular hawker centers with better roasted meats. Tried but unlikely to visit again

This Michelin star restaurant opened to long queues and rave reviews. Couldn't resist joining the masses to find out what all the fuss is about while in Singapore. Managed to walk in without any queues on a weekday and ordered the Toro Char Siew, Roast Duck, Roast Pork, Soya Chicken and egg noodles. The winner of the taste test was the Char Siew. Fans of marbled meat will enjoy this cut. The layered fat and meat remained moist through the roasting process. You get the flavor of juicy meat and fragrant charring with every bite. The roast pork was done equally well. Even layers of fat and meat topped with a crispy skin illustrates a choice cut and technical skill. The soya chicken was tender but didn't carry the fragrance of the soya marinade and cooking. The roast duck was equally tender to the bite with a wafer thin crispy skin but the meat lack any distinct flavor from the marinade and roasting process. Noodles were al dente but nothing extraordinary.With plenty of excellent roast meat substitutes available in Singapore, this Michelin star restaurant has to do a lot more to keep ahead of the pack

The restaurant isn't very large with seating for twosomes or foursomes. They won't seat you until your entire party is present. When the manager gave us that line (one person in our party wasn't with us), we looked in and saw empty tables, and he quickly told us he'll seat us this once, but not to do it again in the future. Service is brisk and efficient. The food came within minutes of us ordering. I had the duck noodles, which was a moderately sized dish (typical Hong Kong cafe size). The noodles were al dente and drizzled in a sauce. The roast duck was very good, tender, succulent and savoury. There was one piece of kai lan with the dish. The barley was authentic home cooked in taste. My friend had the roast duck with rice, which she said was just as good. My other friend had the soup wonton which she rated as average. Like all Hong Kong Cafes, seating is close together, the restuarant slightly stuffy and smelling of the food. No conducive to sitting for long. A decent array of noodles and rice dishes to choose from. Prices were on average $10 per dish, add $5 more if you want the drumstick. The food was tasty, not sure if it warranted the Michelin hype

Delicious roast items, but overhyped. Slightly priced at the more expensive end, but not of the expected quality.
5
A must try, I have never tasted more succulent BBQ pork in my life, practically melts in your mouth and satisfies the soul.
Great tasting roast duck also.
5
Their roasted duck and pork were amazing ! Expecially the TORO Char Siew is the best in the world !!!
It will be melting after inside your mouth!

The wanton mie is nice. The roast duck just Good, the toro chasiew just nice, the service is ok... not bad. Overall is Good

Unfortunately, Kam's cannot import and serve its famous roast goose in Singapore, at least not yet. Its roast duck from Malaysia is good, but is not as scrumptious as the premium Irish birds at London Fat Duck (Scotts Square) or Royal London Duck (Mandarin Gallery). In fact, it's no better than the roast duck at Imperial Treasure or Crystal Jade Palace. The star here is definitely the toro char siew - don't miss it! If Kam's ever gets a star in SIng, it would show how biased the Michelin inspectors are because at least half a dozen other roast joints should get one

...but, unlike the noodle restaurant also with a Michelin star in HK, the portions here are not so Lilliputian! You don't need two (for some people, three) portions of noodles to satisfy your hunger! However, let's admit it, the noodles are less unique than Mak;s. Unfortunately, Kam's cannot import and serve its famous roast goose in Singapore, at least not yet. Its roast duck from Malaysia is good, but is not as scrumptious as the premium Irish birds at London Fat Duck (Scotts Square) or Royal London Duck (Marina Gallery). In fact, it is no better than the roast duck at Imperial Treasure or Crystal Jade Palace. The star here is definitely the toro char siew - don't miss it! Singapore foodies are smart: following the curiosity effect at opening, now there is barely a queue at mealtime, whereas next door Tsuta mee still causes a small tsunami between 11am and 3pm. If this one gets a star in SIng, it would show how biased the Michelin inspectors are because at least half a dozen other roast joints should get one

We had roasted duck and pork rice. The presentation did not give any good impression. Classic HK style should have given at least two vegetables whereby we received only one each. Rice was not hot enough and not like the traditional jasmine fragrant rice smell. Both roasted pork and duck taste was alright but the portioning would not be jestified by the price. The only thing we like about was red bean soup with aged orange peeled. That brought my old memory of good red bean soup from those chinese restaurants.
4
This is the Singapore branch of the one Michelin star Hong Kong roast duck and pork resturant. The roast pork was very close to the one star Hong Kong soya chicken and rice resturant I mentioned earlier and the setting was a clean modern location not a hawker mall. If you want God reliable roast duck and oink rice plate this is a very good, convienently located choic

@TheKuoKnowsHow many Roast Duck restaurants do we actually need in Singapore? The answer is there are never enough, for the moment, at least.Kam's Roast is the latest addition to a an already-crowded Roast Duck market. But the queues outside the restaurant would suggest that total demand has yet to be fully satisfied. Thank goodness that they provide chairs outside.Kam's Roast - whose roots can be traced to Yung Kee in Hong Kong's Central district - is really a specialist in Roast Goose.But we may have to wait an eternity, if not longer, before we see the long-necked poultry on the menu. A goose-ban following the avian-flu epidemic has put paid to that delectable treat.So for now we're just going to have to put up with duck for dinner. And what a delight that can be.Each portion of Roast Duck is perfectly carved. The meat is insanely moist and the presentation irresistibly inviting. The crispy skin is the best bit.The Char Siu, which the restaurant calls Toro, is maddingly mouth-watering. We know that too much fat is not good for us. But in this instance, it might be better to put health matters to one side, or at least until after the meal.The vegetable selection, or lack of selection, was the only let-down. The restaurant only had Choi Sum, rather than Kai Lan on the menu. The latter would be preferable.But I am prepared to overlook the vegetable disappointment, given that the star of the show - the duck - gave a magnificent performance on the night.Take a bow, Kam's Roast because Kam can cook

This is the Singapore branch of the Michelin rated Hong Kong resturant since it was next to the hotel and had a constant que we thought we'd give it a try. We had the roast duck and the roast pork to ce plate and they were both very good, moist without greasiness and very flavorful. The choi sum was firm but tender and also had excellent flavor. A very pleasant experience for a very reasonable pric
4
Succulent char siew, Tender roast duck and Crispy roast pork are a must try and deserves a "4-points rating". One point deducted for the price especially for the roast suckling pig. Tasty, crispy skin but pricey.
1
Came here with expectation. Extremely Disappointed. It served without gravy for both roast pork and roast duck. :(
4
Packed a whole duck for dinner. They are currently running a promo. Whole duck going for $48+ only. Everyone loves the flavourful chunks, the way we like our duck to be chopped up. Can forgo the sauce - tad too salty.
3
3 of us girls had a plate of rice or noodles each. Each plate had a combo of two meats. Portions are just maybe slightly larger than coffee shop with two strands of kailan. The duck was tender and juicy and all the meats were generally good. Add wanton soup, daily soup, side ship and a quarter duck. Added up to a whopping $100! Think I'll stick to coffee shop fare. No reservations allowed except for the private room and all have to be present before they will seat you. Seating is limited.

BBQ pork and Pork Roast noodle are very nice. The skin of pork roast is very crispy and the meat is tender. The BBQ pork are also nice, not too sweet and also tender. Both are combined with noodle.. The noodle isn't over cooked, so hmm..... so so nice... but one thing... the portion is a little bit too small, that we are not too satisfied to enjoy... BTW... it's must be tried..
3
We tried the roast pork noodles and char siew noodles. The roast pork is really great. Skin is crispy and pork is perfect. Nothing special about the char siew. Over-all, it's OK, but not worth the price. Would recommend this for people who like roast pork and doesn't mind to pay premium price for it
2
We did a take away of the roast duck and char siew for dinner at home. It is not worth the money nor the waiting time. Many local roast meat joints and hawker centres in Singapore serve much better roast meat than Kam's. A huge disappointment.

My family was happily looking forward to try the famous roast goose from Kam's Roast located at Pacific Plaza Singapore. Since it's off peak at 2.30pm on a weekday, there was no queue at all. However, we were rejected entry simply because of our sleeping baby in the pram. A diamond studded lady at the cashier claimed that our pram will obstruct them during their service and was expecting us to wake our sleeping baby up. There was no attempt at all to try to accommodate our family in the restaurant (eg. remove a small table, sit our family at a corner, and etc). We were flabbergasted and dumbfounded by such an arrogant response especially so from a One-Michelin-Star restaurant. Maybe they are too successful and didn't need our patronage.TOTALLY Undeserving.I will definitely not recommend this restaurant with such poor service which is not worth anyone's time.

This place was packed when we were here. Ordered roast duck, Crispy pork, toro BBQ pork..with rice and noodles. The duck and pork came very fast.. but the rest took 25 mins to come!! We were asking nicely for the rice, and noodles to be served with the dishes but took so long to come.. the staff seemed lost and the response was typical : "on the way!" Spoilt the entire lunch!! Can't handle the volume of orders, perhaps..Quality of food is average.. I have tried better duck and pork elsewhere.. for the price there are high end Crystal Jade or imperial treasures for nicer decor..Not recommended for the food, service, price and ambience..First and last time..

We ordered the duck combination rice set. One of us had the Char siew and the other the roast pork. However we felt that the roast meat wasn't the best we have eaten. The Char Siew has this light tinge of rose flavour which is rare in the Char siew we have in Singapore. I like the plum sauce that came with the roast duck as it is not overly sweet and there are bits of plum in the sauce
5
finally form Hong kong, and the first Michelin star rated, can be tried here in Singapore. Dont' forget to ordee the noodle, flown in daily from hong Kong.
Great service and awesome hospitality . A must try.

Over rated definitely not Michelin
Rice and noodles is dry
And felt like lots of MSG in food
Nothing like the one in HK

Heard about the famous Kam's roast open in Singapore . Went to try . The "toro" char siew is very nice . Fat and juicy melt in mouth . Otherwise the chicken , roast pork and the noodle so so only . Order two drinks , one rice , one noodle , one double combin and the char siew . Total 60 plus .
1
The roast duck so so only,I'm myself like the char siu,the lotus soup with out the lotus!omg come to the bill the PLAIN noodles cost you $6.80 per plates!after this meal we went to London fat duck at Scott square are much better then you guys!good luck to you

Visited this restaurant for lunch and was astonished when I received the bill! A m wanton soup, a quarter roasted duck, char siew and roast pork came up to the price of $85!The tables are so closely arranged together that literally I can hear so clearly what the next table was saying. To emphasize on the closeness of the tables, I would need to walk sideways to enter into the seat. That's how close it was. If this is a higher end and more classy restaurant, like imperial palace, etc, I would be able to appreciate the prices better. But in view that the restaurant looked more like a food court, the pricing really looks crazy. Though the duck was good, the Char siew above average. But the roasted pork was really normal.
2
The ambience is nothing to shout about. You will find better Cantonese restaurants along Orchard Road.The food is expensive. $22.80 for a standard plate of toro char siu. $6.80 for a plate of plain noodle.I think imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade offer better food than Kam roast
3
Get's very excited to try the toro charsiu and roast duck. Though the roast duck is just fine. Nothing really special. The toro is yummy but could get a little bit more sweet glaze and tasty. The taste is a bit bland for me. Roast pork is okay, nice soft and crispy, love the mustard that come with it. The noodle are yummy, springy and taste just right. Might help if they serve hoisin sauce for someone who prefer more flavor on their meat. Too bad cannot try the michelin star Goose, since is not available in Singapore.
2
I went to Kam's Roast with high expectations but left disappointed. To be fair, the food deserved 3 stars (average) but the overall experience deserved only 2 stars due to the exorbitant prices. The roast duck was average and the roast pork worse than what you'd get at a hawker stall although the mustard sauce was tasty and saved the dish. The soya chicken was good but not any better than what you'd get at Imperial Treasure. However, the supposed star of the meal- Toro Char Siu was a bit of a let down. I would say its above average (because of its cut and the rather pleasant marinade) but cannot come close to Oversea Family Restaurant's version in KL and formerly Singapore. Didn't justify the price tag at all. The noodles were not bad and al dente but fall short in terms of the sauce and seasonings. For the prices they charge, you can get a much better meal at many other places in Singapore
3
Well,it may sound so fantastic by it's 1 star Michelle graded.So as the crowd.Tried the duck,toro char siew,roast pork,soya chicken and their famous noodle.Look good,taste good,but over priced.Service was abit slow,due to limited nos.of order taker,but server plenty.And it not crowded when we was there around 4pm weekend
5
We are roasted pork addict, and had tried every roast-stall in Hong Kong and Singapore whenever possible. We were excited to dine in Kam's at Pacific Plaza after our yoga. At first we were disappointed that their flagship Roast Goose would not be served in Singapore! The queue was moving fast on Saturday lunch time, when we step in the packed resturant, it is a no nonsense Hong Kong style interior that maximise every inch of the space for seat. We had shrimp roe and duck noodles, poached vegetable, Toro Char Siu and Crispy Roast Pork. The noodles is heavenly fine, al dente and flavourful. The Toro Roasted Pork Belly is caramelised to perfection that the honey taste melt in your mouth. The crush of the crispy roast pork is crunchy without the guilt of fat and grease. Roast duck is well seasoned right through to the bone. OMG! This is A-must-try for Roast-Lover! If you order all the signature dishes, It cost about S$40 per head. It is worth it
