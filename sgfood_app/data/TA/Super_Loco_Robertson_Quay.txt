Great taste. Small portions. High price - typical of Singapore. Not great for family with kids. Good meet up for friends.
5
Really had a good time at brunch last weekend -- Sunday. The margaritas were cold and the food was good. Nice little area in RQ and could sit there for hours watching people walk by.
4
Good wholesome food overlooking the bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel ( without the price tag). Great sharing dishes and friendly attentive staff. Can r commend the pitchers of margarita and the chocolate churros
4
Delightful evening meal with "close to" authentic cuisine and scenic river front view. We enjoyed the seared beef tacos with rich taste and tender texture.
4
Lots of choice, good atmosphere, very busy but the waitress settled us at the bar until a table outside was available.

We had flown to Singapore to have one nights stopover to catch up with friends. There has been a history of good nights and margaritas so we decided on Super Loco. Big mistake!! After ordering drinks and deciding on food we were told we can’t have the food we wanted as one couple wanted the set menu and the other just lots of tacos and quesadillas. You’ve literally lost out on hundreds of dollars of revenue due to your inability to be flexible! Seriously disappointed
1
While the menu is aplenty with vegetarian options, the team in the kitchen doesn't understand the importance of preparing meals for vegetarians. I ordered a veg (for myself) and pork burrito (for my partner) but the people mixed up the labeling because of which I ate a few bites of the pork burrito. Being vegetarian all my life, this is unacceptable. The fat Malay guy behind the counter was simply horrible and rude. However Grace (the manager) was understanding of the situation but the kitchen team needs to be told of the massive error they made.
4
Dropped by for a quick meal after flying into Singapore. We always enjoy Mexican food and Super Loco fitted the bill.We chose a quesadilla; and a taco - both brimming with flavour; a bowl of spicy potatoes; with a beer and a peach and ginger non alcoholic cocktail.Service was prompt and we were happy with everything we ordered.We felt that our meal was a little pricey - but this was in no way the fault of Super Loco. We just had to get used to Singapore prices in a hurry

This is a great restaurant. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I love to bring my dog there, and the restaurant is cool with her sitting with us outside. The food is awesome with many different choices. My favorite is the taco. The price is reasonable for the quality of the food. I've been to many different Mexican restaurants and I think Super Loco is one of the best ones. One con is that the service on the weekend can be a little slower than usual, but I understand that on the weekends it can get crowded. Maybe consider making a booking if you prefer inside or outside. Overall a great restaurant
2
Third visit to Super Loco. Very disappointing experience. Despite having a confirmed reservation for an outdoor table we were given a different table. Only after 2 conversations with the Manager did we get the table we requested for - even though the table was vacant. Service was slow and very patchy. Our initial order was taken promptly but we got the wrong drink. To order a second round was a challenge. The fish in the ceviche was stale and was returned- no apology or rationale from them. The pineapple salsa was excellent and the soft tacos were good. However for this price point I certainly expect better food and service. Will not be visiting again.
4
I have totally enjoyed their delicious Mexican food that goes well with my favorite Corona beer. The ambiance is quite relaxing as the Singapore river is just nearby.
5
Dined with two teenage daughters twice here. Right by the Singapore river, its in a good location at Robertson Quay. Menu is filled with traditional Mexican favourites. Food comes pretty quickly and the staff are very friendly. Portions are generous.
4
Apparently this was Mexican street food, which made it all very interesting. No standard tacos/nachos here, but rather a chorizo taco parmesan corn cob and other tasty stuff. Great location, and some helpful staff. Will return.
5
Great food, great atmosphere, great company. Not the run of the mill Mexican food, really unique and flavor some. Lovely setting.
3
Super Loco is busy on weekends. Serves pretty average food. Portion sizes were OK (although smaller than expected). More suitable to casual dining
3
This place has ridiculous prices. I went with some friends for dinner. The tacos were delicious, but it's ONE taco for $12... are they out of their fracking minds? I guess not, as long as suckers like me decide to try it. I have to say, the flavours were generally really great. The prices were not. Five of us spent $275. That's over $55 per person. The enchiladas are completely off the mark. So is the "Mexican Old Fashion" drink - don't try it, even though it sounds delicious. My friends really liked the churros. I didn't
4
Enjoyed our meal at Super loco. To begin with, the margharitas were great, there was something with an orange thing, was really good. Was happy to find a decent amount of vegetarian food and thankfully not all of them were with the same sauces. The corn on cob, with cheese was delish, enjoyed the chips Salsa and guac too. The enchiladas, tostadas and tacos were good too! All in all a good meal with great ambience
3
It was Saturday 19 Aug afternoon and we wanted to have our late lunch and so we found this place quite interesting. We settled down and placed our orders. Incidentally it was also the last order for lunch as we were there about 3:00pm.One of us ordered Toast with Black Beans and others ordered the Taco set, amongst other food on the menu ordered by the rest of us.However when the Taco was served, it came with a bowl of Black Beans. As we are not familiar with Mexican food, we assumed that these were part of the set.The Toast ordered by another friend seated further away from us (there were 14 of us) came quite late. Not knowing that the Black Beans has already been served, she was still waiting for the Black Beans and eventually asked one of the Servers to check her order. Little did we know the Black Beans served together with the Taco was meant for the Toast, and not for the Taco. We told the female server that helped take our orders that the food should be served together with their individual set. Very disappointing that she took it lightly, non apologetic and didn't think it's a big deal.Anyway, food is not fantastic so not likely to visit this again
4
Although i am not typically a Mexican food guy, i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed the chicken tacos. Also had the Sol beer which went well with the food. Friendly and attentive staff. Even though a weekday nite, it was packed after 8pm so best to call and book on weekends
4
We ate on the outdoor patio here on a Sunday night -- perfect! The service was excellent - food was brought to our table quickly and cheerfully. We enjoyed the fish taco (a very ample serving!), chicken quesadillas, and of course the chips and salsa were winners. The pineapple margarita was tasty as well. Everything we ate was delightful - my only hesitation is that the portions were a bit small for the price
5
Myself and my 11 year old daughter ate here twice in our 8 night trip once you work out menu the food is great.
4
Really enjoyed the food, found there was a reasonable variety but would not say there were huge choices but what we ordered was excellent. The vibe was enjoyable and staff helped make the atmosphere. Hopefully there will be another visit.
4
Broad choices on the menu led to great choices for us. Welcoming, attentive staff attended us and our wait was short. We thoroughly enjoyed the range of light options available. A great venue with a nice stroll along the river bank after
5
Popped here for a quick meal over the weekend. I had the fish tacos, delicious. having a few day dreams about them since. Located on the river, great bustling atmosphere. Service quick and friendly. Reasonably priced and nice wine. Will go back to try some more from their men
5
Restaurant was recommended on Google so thought we would give it a try.Server was super friendly and talked us through the menu which was not a familiar format.Food was delicious. Wonderful salad and the steak eaters declared it the best ever (and they know their steak).Highly recommend it
5
If you work anywhere near Super Loco go check it out, even if you don't go here anyway. Only ever been in here on a Friday after work but always have a bucket of cold beers and the steak tacos, the steak tacos are unreal. The cocktails are very decent too and the staff are fantastic. Great buzzy little spot

This place is a real gem in Singapore and we'll be recommending it to any of our friends who visit this great city!It's an airy, relaxed vibe with a tasteful mexican decor and you instantly feel at home. This is aided by the excellent service we received from "Jaya". It's clearly suited to families judging by the colouring-in kids menu, provided pencils, plentiful high chairs and plastic cutlery and plates/cups etc.We visited for a late breakfast and were there when they opened at 10am. We had booked (it was a Saturday and in Melbourne this place would be booked out!), but it's a big space and there were plenty of tables still available at 11am.We were starving and tried lots of their menu items. Our three kids (8, 5, 3yr olds) all loved the pancakes (with pineapple pieces and ice-cream) and avocado toast (comes in both adult and kids sizes, the latter comes with two slices of tomato). I had the Grande Breakfast which was delicious - the hero was the ancho mayo... yum! My wife had the acai bowl (on which she's becoming an expert) and she said it was one of the best she'd had! The coffees were outstanding and were as good as any in Melbourne (and therefore better than Sydney) :-pTheir big range of juices and smoothies were as advertised and very tasty. Everything came out as ordered and quickly. We had some cheeky churros for "dessert" (this was my wife's birthday!) that were fabulous and reminded us fondly of our time in Spain. This isn't the cheapest meal you'll have, but it's quality and service makes it excellent value
5
This restaurant group has a winning formula. Whether with friends or couples it works seamlessly in all their venues. This is our first visit to Robertson Quay and it did not disappoint. A warm, smiling welcome from one of the male waiters, Kelly. Flawless service from an Italian waiter who wore a trainee badge but excelled. Always love the food at Loco and here it is in line with its Sister restaurants - the starters, the tacos, yummy pork ribs, and this time the churros with delicious dipping chocolate. Great wines by the bottle and glass. Love it.
5
Casual friendly fun and good food sums up this little gem at Robertson Quay. A must for you list of places to eat in Singapore. The spicy chicken wings are to die for, beef quesadilla amazing - and the churros didn't even last a minute before they were devoured! Evening topped of with attentive service. We'll be back soon!
4
We had visited this restaurant in hope of good Mexican food. We ordered quesadillas, tacos and the tender beef. The beef was spectacular whilst the formers were satisfactory. My suggestion and my order if I were to go again would without doubt be to get the beef. You should too.
5
The lychee & lime margaritas are highly recommended.( don't try the mango. It's too sweet, and looks artificially flavored)
As vegetarians, we ordered corn chips with guacamole, Quesadilla, Avocado sides, and rice. Worked out very well
Pretty good service, too
4
It was a place where ambience is not only build by the theme of resto but also food and staff. I visited this with several collague and we had great time!
4
First time here and I love it. Unsure what to order but the friendly staff helped with some options. Most of the dishes we order was good. Nice place but overpriced for the drinks
4
Super Loco serves tacos and pretty interesting mexican fusion food. Located on Robertson Quay, the spot gets pretty decent chic crowd in the night. The food is pretty good too and you can hang out with shots of tequila after.
3
Great service and cool ambience. Struggled a bit with the food for the price and the wine/beer choices limited, unless mexican/spanish, so low rating.Guacamole and Salsa Roja with corn chips was a nice starter, if a bit stingy.Chickpea, chicken and pulled pork Tostaditas (on corn chips) were ok and i suggest some spicy sauces on the side would have helped lift the flavours. Mains Arrachera skirt steak was delicious although a half a baby pigs head in our Cochinillo (suckling pig) brought our appetites to a halt. Prefer no pigs heads/teeth please, not everyone likes them
3
I dined at Super Loco with a colleague last week, and we split the bill on both our credit cards. When the waiter took our cards, he was gone for quite a long time. Overnight, both my colleague and myself received text messages from our respective banks alerting us that someone was trying to make fraudulent transactions with our cards. I am obviously not certain that a staff member took our credit card details, but it seems very suspicious to me... I emailed Super Loco about this the day after we dined there and I am yet to hear back from anyone... Food was nice though..
5
Had a delightful & fun night out with friends here. Atmosphere is great! The staff is very welcoming and entertaining throughout the evening. Food is very tasty and cocktails are delicious!Only negative point, if really I need to find one, is that the food is a bit slow and comes out little by little, but if you are a small group and you are happy to try different dishes, its a nice way to share everything
5
I was craving for Mexican food like nachos around 9pm. And, my friend brought me to this, Super Loco Restaurant which offer great Mexican street food. We ordered Totopos (fresh corn chips) with Salsa and Guacamole dip. The Guacamole dip is just... muacks (amazing)! After awhile, Res Quesadillas ( corn tortillas sandwich with slow cooked beef) arrived at our table. The Res Quesadillas wasn't up to my expectations as the slow cooked beef just tasted normal , and it's not flavorful enough for me (this is depends on everyone palate). The Pollo Tostaditas was good, the chicken tinga was marinated well and it tastes good with the chipotle mayo. Overall, the Mexican food served was good! I'll visit the restaurant again to try out other food! One specific thing would like to bring up, there's a female service attendant ( sorry, I forgot her name) who provide very friendly service throughout my visit and she even offer to accompany me to walk to the restroom as I am not familiar with the area. Thumbs up for her great service.

Went here with the crew from work and was pleasantly surprised not your usual burritos, tacos , chimichangas or fajitas. They may have well been on the menu but we had the funky corn, some ceviches, succulent steak slices all of which were very tasty and dangerously more-ish. Inevitably a few of the gang went for and raved about the churros!A good night was had by all even though no one chanced their arm on the extensive range of tequila!It was busy for a midweek night and quite a few tables with families. Definitely worth a go!
3
Just visited on Easter Weekend. I arranged a high table adjacent to river. Atmosphere was great, beautiful fragrant smell in air and clientele that looked very expat and less tourist. For me Robertson Quay is more for locals and less tacky then downstream at Clarke / Boat Quays. I ordered the Beef and Chorizo taco and it was beautiful and smokey. This was followed by the suckling pig share plate. It was nice, though lacked enough salsa and sauce and felt like a lump of meat on the plate. During my meal it was very difficult to capture attention of wait staff, particularly the young lady cleaning menus (she did an amazing job here but missed out on three additional drink orders). I left a little frustrated. Also the menu is quite limited and would benefit with additional range
5
Great Mexican food! One would think it would be hard to find good Mexican food in Asia, but not the case! The food here is delicious. Great atmosphere too.
5
Last weekend i went with my friends there and i love to eat tacos and i also order toastaditas and anchosticks. Very delicious and excellently recommended by Nishchey. I like to recommend this restaurant to every person must visit .
5
This is a great place and it has great small plates to share. Tried cerviche here and it was great. Love Mexican food and found this to be delcious. Wait staff is very friendly and it is a fun place.
4
Super Loco Mexican Restaurant located in Robertson Quay. Lively crowd. I tried the steak- yummy in the tummy!! A bit pricey if on a tight budget. Average per person dinner and a drink Singapore $ 50.00 Friendly servers.
4
The place was quite busy for a week day. The Staff was very welcoming and helpful. They helped us with recommendations and also updated about recently introduced dishes which were not on the menu. We reached during happy hours in the evening and got a very good deal for the Sol beer. Tried it for the first time, and surprisingly it was very smooth (just like corona). There were a lot of options on the menu (vegetarian friendly too!), but we only tried the Alitas De Polllo (chicken wings), Chorizo Y Res Tacos (beef), Cordeo Taco (lamb, which was recently introduced), Pollo Quesadilla (chicken) and Some Quesadilla in beef. That's not all. We repeated these items again!! Highly recommended place to go to and food is very tasty too! Wish we had space to eat some more! But never mind, we might be going again next time for sure! It's a bit pricey place, but then, they have no service charge!! Service is quick and the atmosphere is casual (but not loud). Definitely visit!!

Five of us stopped in Super Loco last night for dinner. Being along the River we weren't expecting "cheap Mexican food." Initially the service was attentive and quite good as we pored over the menu and made our selections. It turns out that the food was very tasty and innovative (hats off to the chef), but there were no customary chips served (for free), and then the food was brought in 5 separate orders. Two people were completely done before the others had even received their food -- management needs to train the staff to do a better job. A table of five wants to dine as a table of five, not as five individual diners
4
Visited for dinner with a colleague and her young son, and ordered an assortment of starters, tacos and quesadillas, with a couple of cocktails. The food was tasty (the corn on the cob is particularly good) and the cocktails were fruity albeit didn't taste especially alcoholic! The whole restaurant has a really nice relaxed vibe.
5
Great restaurant in Robertson quay best location near by river and fresh exotic food and great service staff i love one of unique name i really don't remember NISH.. he was very polite and best in recommended food more than that passion fruit samshito was very good and i would love to come again for a birthday event thank u superloco ! Thanks again to (Nish...
4
Managed to get a table for early dinner at Saturday. Place seems to be quite busy during the weekend. I liked the authentic atmosphere a lot. I walked by earlier on the same day and the dishes looked very nice. Lot of them are sharable, which I like. Food was delicious, proper Mexican. Drinks were bit on the expensive side. But nice experience anyway
3
This place is well located, the service is decent, however the food was not good. We all went to another place in Boat quay for proper dinner because we didn't like the food in Super Loco and although we did eat something, we were still hungry... The prices were quite high, particularly when you don't like the food. Also, there were a lot of us, about 12 people, and none of us liked it, so this is not a biased opinion. I recommend to skip this restaurant
2
No value at all for the money.
Way to expensive for normal street food.
Food is average Mexican at best.
Not coming here again.
4
I've tried most of the Mexican restaurants in Singapore and this is among the best. While it's not exactly authentic Mexican it is about as close as you can get in Singapore.
4
Tacos ,Salsa and cocktails etc etc all were very nice . Will love to visit again for sure .. Nice view of Singapore river
5
The chips and salsa were as good as any I've had. And I'm from USA and eat Mexican often. Also had the chicken enchiladas who ch were fantastic. And margaritas were the real thing. Definitely will visit again.
2
You will encounter lots of foreigners partying, while spending insane amounts of money for cocktails. Food tastes OK-good, but servings are very small. I am not mexican, but had mexican food a few other times in my life, and this is not a restaurant i'm fond of.Makes sense to go if money is not an issue. Place looks great, and you can have a great time, if you are willing to spend about 50S$ per person. We felt a bit cheated, for the bad value for money. The place is not bad and actually looks nice!, but given the price, i personally find it not worth it
3
Super loco is a great place with amazing view of the singapore river. The place is large with indoor and outdoor seating area. We went as a group of 8 and started with some mexican beer and chips and some mexican starters. We continued with the main courses by ordering some tacos, enchiladas and quesadillas. Unfortunately they did not meet our expectations, mainly the tacos were super sour and salty. The enchiladas were rather too spicy as we asked the waiters if they are spicy or not but they said they are not spicy which ended up none of us could finish them. The quesadillas were better compare to other food we ordered but the wraps were not so fresh and tasted rather hard and chewy. Well overal the location is great for drinks and its view but it disappointed us for its main courses.
5
This is a great place to chill out on a weekend afternoon at Roberston Quay. There many indoor and outdoor seats but the place gets filled up rapidly. Service was pretty good.We ordered a jug of passion fruit -mint cocktail with Mount Gay rum. Was a bit watery but gave one the kicks nevertheless. :))) Benedictos (Egg, cheese , ham) was quite good and so were the tortilla chips with salsa and Guacamole dip. Overall, a nice afternoon
5
Most places in Singapore have no clue how to deliver customer service. They should go learn from Super loco . I visit the Robertson Quay Branch.The food is always spot-on, constantly of high standard. I love the way they refurbished the place, it makes for the perfect spot for your business lunch or dinner, to meet a friend or bring family to. The service was very good. our waitress, shasha impress me with her smile attitude and professionalism thank you for looking after me and my firends. i would say all of the staffs are friendly too You can rest assured that you dine in staff will make you feel welcome and you'll leave with a pleasant experience. Thank you super loc
5
Food yummy! The sizes of the plates were all small and great for sharing. We had 4 between us: the chorizo y res (beef and chirozo tacos), costilla de cerdo (pork ribs), Cordero (lamb enchiladas) and can't remember the name of the last thing, sorry! All were delicious, apart from the Cordero which were disappointingly bland. Good service
1
The location is good but it's just that unfortunately. We didn't like the food; the lamb especially smelt. Margaritas were really diluted. Not worth the money spent
4
Met friends for dinner. Food of a very high quality and location and atmosphere terrific. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Prices are quite high.
5
Really enjoyed this chilled breakfast by the river. If you're hungry, the breakfast burrito is the way forward. Soooo good! However, everything else looked just as awesome! A great breakfast to set you up for a few hours strolling along the river. Superb!
5
This is one of our favourite places to eat (or drink). The food is fantastic, especially their breakfast and the service is wonderful!
4
Located in the heart of Robertson Quay, super loco is a place that glitters in the night. Margaritas, Tacos, the place serves good quality mexican street food. Great place to hangout in big groups.
3
Had dinner here with my mother and daughter on our first night in Singapore and was very disappointed. We know that eating out in Singapore can be expensive and I don't mind paying money for good food but this place is over priced. To start with we had corn chips with a small serve of guacamole which was very bland. For mains my daughter had some sort of chicken torillas which came out as bite-sized and tasted terrible and looked like something you wouldn't even give your pet. My mother and I had enchiladas with one small one for each of us. You really need 2 for a meal. The flavor was ok but wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. We had one round of drinks and the bill was over $150 and left feeling hungry and disappointed
5
Had Sunday brunch here after a big night out with friends and we arrived famished. Good thing the service was quick and the portions large. We were initially saddened that the breakfast burrito that we wanted to have was no longer available but we replaced it with the DIY Taco and was the best item we had that day. We ordered huevos rancheros and pulled pork tortas which were also good I suppose since all the food were gobbled up in under 15 minutes.
4
The restaurant and bar is directly located at Singapore river and has a very nice surrounding. It is a great place to go for some casual relaxing dinner and to enjoy typical Mexican food and to have some great margaritas. They have also a huge selection of tequilas and we can recommend the quesadillas, the sliced Angus beef, the churros for dessert and the pisco sour. All in all, a good choice to enjoy an evening in Singapore!! Prices are rather high in this area.
4
This place serves great Mexican food (not Tex-Mex!), serves great drinks, and has a wonderful atmosphere. Really nice view of the river and amazing staff.The only reason it doesn't score a 5, is because the prices are steep! Case in point: SGD 8 for a single small meat-filled flour tortilla (estimate 4-5 of these babies to count as a full meal). It really adds up if you're hungry!Go, but be prepared to pay. They do accept credit cards at least
4
Interesting that happy hour runs until 6pm but the restaurant only opens at 6pm.Even though we arrived at 6:10pm they still honoured our first round at happy hour prices .The food was of a good standard and the restaurant is centrally located just across the bamboo bridge.Would definitely go back
1
If you like expensive corn chips with dip then this is the place for you. If you want real Nachos then find another place. The margaritas are also a let down, no salt on rim and no lime. We left after starters. No point ordering mains
4
Was better than expected, great service, good food. The only drawback was this is mexican street food for people who can afford expensive street food and the music playing was Cuban and Brazilian
5
Great breakfast, great service. Awesome view by the river. Would definitely come back. Laid back and casual atmosphere. Good for families too
4
Nice mexican place at the quayside in singapore... The margheritas was really good... The food is also nice... The overall feel of the place is good.
4
Lucha Loco created quite a stir when it opened here a few years ago. Wonderful food, party atmosphere and beautiful people. But you can't reserve a table and it's impossible to get parking anywhere near the restaurant.Then they opened Super Loco in Robertson Quay. Far bigger and an easier place to get to, easier to park as well. I've been there three or four times and on my last visit I think I've dispelled the notion that the food in Super Loco is not quite as good as in Lucha Loco.At the end of the day I can't really fault this restaurant. It's always busy but they try very hard to accommodate you - and to give you an honest estimate of how long you have to wait for a table. I'm not terribly fond of eating outdoors but it works well here, overlooking the river and people-watching.The food is just excellent and so totally different from your regular burrito/enchilada fare of most Mexican restaurants. The food is top quality and although it's not cheap, I get filled up pretty soon. How good are the elotes? The Baja fish taco are amazing. Don't miss the sides such as the rice and the beans. What I do miss, however, is their blue corn cake. That was amazeballs. What a shame that's not on the menu any more. The same goes for the chili rebleno
5
I incidentally found this super cool Mexican restaurant (beach style), with great food and taste.As a Mexican I must say that this place went beyond my expectations by far, which makes me feel happy for them, considering that the place is plenty of customers.Finally no "Tex Mex" but the real Mexican culinary style and mood
3
We are a family of four who were "walk-ins" last Saturday night. Though the restaurant was quite crowded, a table was made available to us without too much of a wait. The waitress who brought us the menu cards was pleasant enough, but then she disappeared. It took us a while to catch a waiter eye to come over, who in turn sent some one else to take our order. Unfortunately this gentleman (who was not in a uniform) wasn't quite helpful - I asked whether we could get some cheese on our nachos and he said Nada, as this was a Mexican restaurant and not a Tex-Mex one. After that I asked whether we could get a pitcher of a virgin Margarita (sans alcohol for my kids) and he shot us down quite brusquely, saying everything is pre-mixed.I was amused to learn that they serve a premixed slushy as a Margarita, rather than make it from scratch. Considering the price of a pitcher is $45 plus, that's one expensive slushy. We got the same response on asking for some vegetarian options, as he wasnt willing to go beyond the 3 vegetarian dishes on the menu. I have found other Mexican restaurants in Singapore to be more flexible in their approach to generating vegetarian options from the menu, clearly this wasnt one of them.The food arrived in a while, and I have to admit that while the food itself was decent the appetizer portion sizes were very small. At the end of the meal the same waiter piles all the plates one on top of the other in front of me, waving the cutlery close to my face, to save making a trip to the kitchen to bring a tray. Overall, a very average experience, I doubt I will be back
4
Amazing location on the waterfront overlong Marina Bay Sands. Good menu and locally made food. Staff very helpful and attentive giving advice on spiciness and flavours!Fast service and tasty food. Only downside was it being very dark at night so had to read menus with torches
4
Super Loco is the awesome, riverside spin-off from Duxton Hill's Lucha Loco, and it consistently delivers.The place is ALWAYS packed with regular customers, a sign of its popularity.Definitely recommend checking it out for fast and friendly service, great food and cocktails, and a lively atmosphere.The blood orange margaritas are a favorite, as is the avo toast with poached eggs. Delicious
4
Nice atmosphere, attentive staff.initially music was a little bit too loud making conversation difficult, but after 10 they put volume down.Food was okay - tacos with guacamole and salsa were very good though.Rest of the nibbles didn't disappoint, but didn't amaze us either.Tasty margaritas!Thumbs up - definitely place to come back again
2
It had been ages since I went to Super Loco and its predecessor, Lucha Loco. I was quite disappointed with its food tonight. The cochinita pibil was not red enough. There was just not enough achiote in it. It was quite tasteless also. The elote used to be my favourite. Tonight it was over smothered with cheese. The corn was not sweet or plump enough. We also had the chips and guacamole. The avocado was perfect but again it was quite bland. Disappointing and pricy
4
Great atmosphere, good brunch and affordable price. Friendly staff but it was busy so service took a while.
4
Great place for mexican bites. Good service, good location, good prices. We enjoy the small tapa type dishes. I haven't come across a happy hour as such but they do have margaritas on special certain days. Great place, will definitely go back
4
Went here with friends and it's in a nice location with a lively/friendly vibe around ..The food was quite good here and overall really happy
4
Great central location, with a good range of Tex-Mex products in a modern environment. Good service with friendly staff.
5
We had the 5 course meal. It was varied and very good and more than we could eat. It was a bit spicy, but we got sour cream and more guacamole to mitigate that :)
4
I had the available super bowl which was very unusual and involved quinoa porridge - it was very good indeed. Lots of good options for breakfast/ brunch, although they don't start serving until 10 am on a Sunday.
4
If you're craving for Authentic Mexican food in Singapore this place is for you. Nice location, very close to Clarke Quay. Cool and friendly staff. Meal quality was awesome. Service is fast and very relaxing ambiance. Affordable and a must try!!! Don't forget to grab a bottle of Sol :) ooh so yum!!!

Me and my friends join for dinner last Wednesday night. We are pretty excited about the place because of the good food and drinks feedback so we try it out! It was not busy! We were been greeted by the tall girl (i think shes the host) and sat us down to our dine in table i ask if we can move to the other table but she said "no" we can't because that table is reserved (which is understandable) but the way how she say it is not pleasing and professional at all like she was trying to say in sarcastic way that are you blind cant you see there's a reserve sign and we ask for a water she said sure and she rolled her eyes and walked away. 10 minutes later no water came then guy ask us if we would like to have something to drink and without any hesitation he gave us the water and offer his service i can't remember his name but I remember he got cross tattoo in his wrist. He is charming and gentle all throughout his service was excellent it mend the anger and very unprofessional experience that we had from the host. The food was very good but some food came out very slow especially the mains. The calamansi margarita was amazing. This review could have been 5star but sad to say in some point its not.

We went here because of our friends recommended this place. In a great location on a sunny Sunday, the place was very packed. The service was fast, but food wise... It's not so flexible, there are many things that can't be done upon request. They need to be more flexible on it. Regardless of the inflexibility of the food request, I had the best Avocado Toast I've ever tasted with a perfection of runny poached eggs
1
We arrived at Super Loco after hearing rave reviews about the restaurant. The place was very busy, staff very welcoming and the cool lightning added to the vibrant atmosphere. We chose the tortilla chips with guacamole to begin with. Tortilla chips were light & guacamole tasty but sparse. We had to ask for another bowl to accompany the big basket of chips. So far not so bad.... However We had both ordered the enchiladas with pollo. We were presented with 3 small dried up enchiladas. They were hard to cut into, very dry and bland. The salsa verde & sour cream did not improve the disappointment whatsoever. We did not finish our meal & ordered churros to fill us up. Churros were also overcooked and inedible. We left most of them on the plate:(.  We would be very very reluctant to darken this restaurants overpriced door again! Still seems popular with other customers though!

Family friendly, fun venue next to the river. Good deals during happy hour. Food was tasty, a little slow on delivery - 2 of us got food, 2 had to wait quite a while. Enjoyable evening. 😊

Went there with the kids and a old Friend and her family visiting town. A Saturday around noon. Had to try the blood orange and guava margarita. Felt it was missing something. Followed up with a passionfruit cocktail- name escapes me but it was nice. The group went for a variety of dishes. My youngest enjoyed the avocado on toast. Son and heir (18) had the big breakfast ( can't remember it's Mexican Monica but no doubt Grande something). Huge but didn't beat the Hoover who sucked it all up together with anything anyone left on their plate other than a sprig of dill. He loved it. I had the Hueva Rancheros ( or something like that). Ordered a side of chorizo and esquites ( corn with a spicy mayo). Comes with cheese quesadilla, eggs, lots of avocado, black beans etc and it was great. Some other items others had not quite up there and the dinner menu has a wider variety with many GF options. Can't comment on that but as a brunch spot I loved it. Most of the clientele look nothing like me so the aesthetics are pretty good too
3
Food was average, nothing special. Limited menu selection. Mosquitoes spotted and was a victim of it. Management perhaps should provide some mosquito spray for diners sitting outside. Nice ambience though. And service was good.
5
Great location, lively atmosphere, great service (very prompt, attentive, casual and friendly). We were there on a busy Friday evening without reservation. They take your number and call you. Wait was about half hour and well worth it! Menu has great variety and all dishes were super tasty, especially the ribs and ceviche. Margueritas went well with it. Recommended
5
Saturday night, - we had walked past during the day - looked fab. Evening meal - very warm welcome, South American music, fans going full blast. Nice smiling clientele- much better than Smoke and Mirrors on the Friday where all people wanted to show off. Crab tostado tad to die for, frozen margarita, ceviche on sea bass, all finished all too quick. Main course sea bass with spicy vegetables. We liked all so much we ordered chorizo taco and small chicken tacos. All arriving very fast and super fresh and tasty, delivered by unusually friendly staff. Obviously some may be too spicy for some but we couldn't get enough!We were offered a free dessert with caramellized hazel nuts and ice cream. Very tasty. We loved the food, the atmosphere and the friendliness. We will come back
5
I spent few years in South America eating ceviche so when I'm in a Mexican restaurant (ceviche is Peruvian, no Colombian, no Chilean...) in another country I order with low expectations. Normally the limes aren't strong enough or the balance of tender just cooked fish, sour, salty, fresh flavours isn't right. So very happy with the delicious ceviche starter i had at Super Loco. Can also highly recommend the rich beef brisket cooked with chorizo soft taco! Ambience is good, outdoor/indoor by the river but with enough aircon and fans to make it a good temp nearer the bar. Definitely recommend.
4
The ambience at Super Loco is perfect for dining friends - casual, alfresco, beside the Singapore river. That sets the stage for a good dinner. We tried a number of items in the menu, including the corn cob and the starter chips with guacamole and salsa dips. I liked the Pollo Quesadilla, though the serving size is small. A good match is Sol beer. The bucket size will save you about S$2 per bottle. The frozen margarita was good as a starter too. Churros with chocolate dip at the end of the meal is highly recommended. Service is quick and warm. On peak hours though, getting the attention of the waiters takes more effort. One place to visit again.
3
Went there with friends and tried many dishes I did not know about. Service is good overall but when portions came, that was a joke! Some dishes had enough for only 1 bite! Not what you expect when you go to a Mexican. Would I go back: no!
4
Arrive before 7pm and you may be in time to order happy hour drinks.No fajitas or chilli con carne on the menu, but there is a variety of other items to select from. Dishes were on the slightly smaller size given the price, but delicious.Unfortunately two of the four dessert items were unavailable when we visited.Nice alfresco dining, worth considering
5
We arrived in Super Loco with a very warm welcome by the host "Kelly". After seated,he opens the menu and introduced us the best seller items which I can only remember is the Quesadilla de Pollo and the Corn in the cub with cheese and chilli powder and the rest I forgot the name (sorry) and I was speechless with how you prepare the food,because it was done whole heartedly. I was really happy and so as my tummy. Again thank you team for making my stay a memorable one especially to very charming Kelly. We'll definitely come back soon! Cheers

Great food Great Margheritas
Go here - we loved it.
All the tacos are yummy & my chicken quesadilla was delish.
The churros (donuts) a yummy way to finish.
4
Good food , great service. The corn on the cob covered in cheese was awesome. The portions were good.
4
The Quesadillas a head where wonderful, atmosfeer and service good, you have to call and reserve as its quit popular.
5
Lately I am rating many Mexican restaurants in Singapore. And enjoy each and every one! no exception here - very good. We had the brunch menu with Huevos Rancheros, taco plate (al pastor) and avocado toast. All were very good. especially, of course, the corn, as starter. Just line in Xochimilco (OK, not same type of corn, but still very good!)
3
Atmosphere is pretty good and overall experience with friends was good. But the food quantity and taste fell short of expectation. Unsure if I can pinpoint specific dishes or just overall experience. Could be a bad day as the place seems to have good traffic. Unsure I would go again
3
High-energy, casual-dress neon-diner like place filled with young families and mainly expats on a weekend evening. Churros were excellent, nice wings, elotes and alcachofa (artichoke + avocado side), decent tacos (fresh bbq fish, ox tongue and beef cheek) that fell a little flat on the seasoning and balance, drinks were good. Spent quite a lot more than we would have liked and the glaringly huge NO SERVICE CHARGE stamp in red on the bill and hovering wait staff waiting to collect the bill can create quite a bit of pressure on the customer to write in a big tip
5
I love everything about Super Loco! The food, drinks, service and ambience! Coming from California where I love all types of Mexican food from taco trucks to cantinas, I have very high standards. I was pleasantly surprised to find such amazing authentic Mexican food in Singapore! I loved it so much that I visited three times and tried their weekend brunch on 2 occasions and went for dinner earlier this week. All of the ingredients were fresh and it was a perfect mix of Mexican staples and a few Mexican dishes with a twist! The zucchini quinoa fritters with smoked salmon and hamburguesa were my favorites for brunch and I loved the baja fish taco, street style corn and snapper and mango ceviche. Churros are always a must to finish off with. They also have a huge variety of tequila and a killer margarita.This is the perfect spot for brunch with kids and family, after work drinks and dinner. I am definitely recommending this to anyone visiting Singapore and all of my friends who live in the area! Canâ€™t wait to go back

This is a cool little Mexican place on Robertson Quay. The food was great and the cocktails were fab as well. Only thing was the food came at different times which wasn't a big issue but they did manage to miss one of our orders completely... But staff were friendly enough.P.S try the corn on the cob
3
Was visiting a friend in the area. They had heard mixed reviews of the place but we were in the mood for Mexican.The hostess was terrible. She told us if would be a 15 minute wait, even though they had plenty of open tables. I asked about them and she said she was unsure. It took almost 30-45 minutes before we were sat and that only happened because after 25 minutes we asked a manager what was going on.They had a good Michelada so I wasn't mad but wasn't happy about waiting.After being seated we ordered food from the manager because the server never came and he had come to check on us.The food was delayed and wrong. We noticed the table next to us was getting items we had ordered and even told their server who said, "you use you didn't order, you can keep". That was very agitating and annoying to hear.All in all the place was so-so. Would i come back here again was it was less busy, totally. It seemed like a cool place with a hip vibe, it just need organization & logistic help
3
We ordered nachos for starters and enchiladas and quesadillas. It was obvious that this restaurant is far from Mexican, it is definitely very Singaporean.If you want to eat excellent Singaporean meal you go to hawker center or good Chinese restaurant. If you want to eat a good Mexican dinner, don't go Super Loco. It seems that the chef is this restaurant knows how to pour chilli (the bitter one), but he doesn't know any other seasoning. I've been eating in Mexican restaurants all over the world including Mexico and food this joint offers is far from Mexican tasty food.This place gets three stars for the effective and friendly service and for the location by the Singapore river
4
Has the avocado toast and the sunny side up eggs. Both were delicious. Sunday afternoon. The place was packed and a good vibe about it.
Will go back for sure.
5
nice staff
they have excellent Mexican food, the best I've had in Singapore, their street Tacos are to die for, and the frozen Margaritas are very good, but they are the world smallest Margaritas!!
4
When traveling for business stay around the area and visit Super Loco for a quick bite for dinner along the Singapore riverStaff is very friendly and good serviceUsually have the Tacos and have a side of the Mexican Rice - that combination gives you a good combination similar to a Burrito BowlIt is a good place to get a moderately price dinne
4
Located in Robertson Quay, farther from the touristy areas, this is a very good Mexican-style restaurant. Food was good and the atmosphere was fun. Set right along the river, it's all open-air. You can make reservations for groups of a certain size, and it does fill up fast when the place opens around 6 pm. Cocktails and food are pretty good. Only issue is portion size is a bit smaller than other restaurants in the area. This means you need to order more, but as you'll see it's no dishes are inexpensive here. Worth it though, as you likely won't find many places in SE Asia serving Mexican food this good. Great spot to bring friends for lounging and enjoying cocktails after work along with some good food. Note, this is also one of the few restaurants not including a service charge in the bill, so be sure to leave a nice tip for good service
3
...I can't. Not sure what it is about this place, perhaps because it's more of a huge sprawling bar, or because the chairs are so uncomfortable it seems unwelcoming, or because the chef is not as good as Lucha Loco, I can't seem to put my finger on it. Stick to the Duxton branch, it definitely won't disappoint!
5
I was there with my BF today for Sunday Brunch. As i'm a plant based foodie its always a challenge to find a healthy spot were both of us are happy with the menu. But here it is - we've had the Acai Bowl and the Breakfast Burrito & some fresh made smoothies. Eyerthing was fresh, tasteful and very yummie. The service was fast & friendly and the location is nice placed direct by the water.
5
It was a Saturday brunch and the restaurant was packed. Had a great vibe to it with warmth and friendly staff, really felt inspired. The food tastes were adventurous but at the same time tasty and the Bloody Mary on offer was superb!Young atmosphere for 30 somethings and really a super place right on the quay, a must visit if in Singapore.
4
We seemed to walk for a long time thinking this restaurant was closer to Clarke Quay but it was totally worth it !! Every food plate that was suggested by the waitstaff was awesome and to top it off the frozen margarita's were amazing !! Totally loved it and it was a great change from the usual Singapore (amazing and yummy) food dishes. We even found a short cut walk on the way home....xx
2
We were just passing by and we decided to take a chance as There are not so many Mexican restaurants in Singapore. The place was lively for an early Saturday evening, full of families with kids. It looked promising. We were seated immediately by a friendly staff member. We were attended to quite quickly and we promptly placed our order. However, when the arrived we were disappointed by the portion size. And the dish my husband and I shared included no bread or rice. We asked the waiter if we could order some on the side and he said we could order tortillas separately, but they were not on the menu. We had no idea what the charge would be for them, thankfully they were not so pricey because they were the smallest tortillas I have ever had. The was no happy hour either. All in all the staff was great, but too expensive for what you get
4
Tacos are the best, so are the ceviche starters and don't forget to have the cocktails tequila based. We went with friends and sitting outside was pleasant despite it being a warm day. The light breeze was welcome. Service is prompt and attentive
4
We've been to Super Loco a few times and have always really enjoyed the food. But expect to pay for it. You can easily sink over $100 for a couple of people and that's before any drinks. My favourite is the Elotes (corn) - that is amazing
5
Get down here to try this place out!! It is by far the best place for brunch in Singapore!! Tacos are the BOMB and the margaritas taste like they come straight from Me-hi-co! *hot tip* MUST TRY the Acai bowl for brunch, the chorizo tacos for dinner, churros with chocolate sauce for dessert!
2
Really bad tasting Mexican food. Bizarre ice cream. Waiter didn't bring one of our meals. Very over priced drinks, even by singa standards.
4
Have been here at least three times now, and I've been impressed by a few things. First: drinks are not cheap, but they are well made. Having worked in my collage days at a Mexican restaurant, I learned what a decent Margarita should taste like. Their Grand Margarita is really good. Second: they have a varied menu with some lesser known dishes that are well worth trying, like the Elotes with Cotija Cheese (corn on the cob with a lovely cheese coating) and the ceviche, which is often attempted, but seldom well-executed. Snapper and mango version was really good. Third: Servers worked as a team and were friendly, prompt and polite. Other observations: Food came quickly; the crab tostadas had the delicate flavor of the crab but were lacking in a counterpoint and came across a bit bland; house-made chips were crispy and fresh; noise level inside was above comfortable for an easy conversation but good for a let-loose night out with a group of friends. All in all, a good choice at Robertson Quay
4
We passed by the restaurant by accident, didn't expect this place is open for breakfast/brunch. A sister restaurant of Luca loco at duxton hill. The Acai super Bowl is delicious and healthy. The pulled pork sandwich was yummy. They also have many other options. service is good, quick and helpful. Suitable for weekend breakfast with family and kids. Will come back again!
3
Super loco has one of the best locations in Robertson Quay right on the river. It's great for a chilled out dinner on Sundays. Brunch is pretty tasty, but dinner is very mediocre. Most dishes are quite bland, even though I never thought food was great but this last time I went back was especially disappointing. Tongue and cheek taco and tuna tartare were probably the best, guacamole and this other fish civiche were not so great. Would go back for brunch and drink pre or after dinner but will not have dinner next time
3
tried this for a weekend brunch. the good part is that its right by the Singapore river and hence there is a fair amount of open space for the kids to run around while the parents can eat and talk. and when we were there i did see quite a few parents doing just that. The not so good part was the food. i've had mexican in multiple cities of the world and multiple places in Singapore and this would not even figure in the top 20 experiences. the only highlight of the meal was equites which was quite tangy and the corn was fresh. the breakfast burrito and the avocado toast were quite average. meat was not juicy. will go back to Boomerang in the next block for my next brunch
5
Delicious food , fantastic drinks and delightful service !! We tried their quinoa chicken salad and lobster tortas - great taste !! Their spicy margaritas stood out!Overall , a great place to relax with good food/drinks after work or over the weekend.
4
You won't miss Super Loco on the river... always busy anytime of the day (well after 10:30 am when it opens - would be nice to be earlier for breakfast!!). Great atmosphere and good food. Been really impressed with their breakfasts - and even the coffee! Margaritas and all the other drinks are great too
4
Found this one to be one of the better Mexican restaurants with a great corner locationBuy the frozen margarita's by the jugstick with the fresh salads - mango ceviche is pretty good (had better)and a good surprise is the corn on cobthe rest you can't go too far wron
1
I was seated and waiting for 20 minutes before no one came to my table to take my order....after that I just left.
4
Really enjoyed a large variety of Mexican food. This places has a fun filled atmosphere with great and attentive staff. Will definitely be back
5
Great mexican food on at Robertson Quay. We tried some different tacos and tostaditos everything was so good that we came back.
4
Authentic Mexican food is difficult to find out Mexico and Singapore is no exception except for Super Loco along the Singapore River at Robertson Quay.The indoor/outdoor setting and ambiance are reminiscent of resort locations in Mexico and the waitpersons are naturally pleasant and focused on providing good service, which is also a welcome surprise in Singapore.This is a great spot to meet your friends for a casual catch-up and brunch on the weekend followed by a stroll along the Singapore River.Definitely try the Super Huevos Rancheros with a margarita of your choice
5
Just love Super Loco. Been here a few times and felt compelled to write a review. The staff are so friendly and nice, a few of them remembered me when i came back my second time. Totally addicted to the tacos! Tried nearly all of them and they are all super tasty. Sit on the tables in the outside terrace near the river, great for people watching
5
I live in the neighbourhood and walked past many times before deciding to give this place at a try, and what a delightful surprise! Tasty food and drinks, can see why this place always has a good crowd any night of the week. I am a big fan of the chorizo taco and the churros are about the best i have had in Singapore. I visited on a Monday and it was almost full and service was prompt and friendly. I see lots of comments about pricing, I actually found it to be quite reasonable for Singapore and for the quality of food, not sure where the other reviewers are used to dining!! I will be coming by again soon Super Loco. Keep up the good work
2
Taste is below average and portions are very small... Price is ridiculous considering quality of taste and size of portions. Smallest margarita ever for the price! If you like Mexican food don't go... Only + is the locatio
3
the food tastes amazing, but the portions are super mini and expensive. the service isnt too great either...but nice ambiance and yummy foo
5
I had the EL Grande breakfast - I'm not a fan of beans for breakfast but these Mexican beans were great! The portion size was the right size for me. The coconut water and detox juice was refreshing! 
2
I visited with my wife and 3 kids for dinner and were very disappointed. Their website made it seem like a fun, festive environment - however it was no different to any other restaurant in Robertson or Clarke Quay, The menu is very limited and the portions are quite small. Moreover, apart from the kids menu items all dishes are quite spicy. Finally the alcohol is very expensive as well.We were seated outside and while the tables are reasonably close together Overall disappointing experience - the staff however are quite friendly
4
Friendly staff. Good service. Tasty authentic Mexican. The only thing stopping this place getting 5/5 is the price and the small amount of guacamole. We will be back! Churros were fantastic. Corn cob is delicious.
4
Pros: Nice place to chill with friends. Food is tasty and filling. Service is prompt and cheerfully rendered.
Cons: The high table with stools becomes uncomfortable after some time. Limited vegetarian options.
5
Awesome place, great location and amazing food. We are big fans of fusion style cuisine and also Mexican. A friend who lives in Singapore recommended the place as a Mexican joint, so we really did not expect the fusion element and we were very pleasantly surprised. My favourite: the fish burrito with quinoa, good old spicy Mexican flavor with a twist, fresh and very well selected ingredients + limemmm... really tasty, so tasty we had to visit again that very weekend. At night the place is full of people and positive vibes. Second time we were actually a bit late and kitchen was closing but they still found us a table and served us great food. Definitely recommend visiting
4
We recently headed out to Robertson Quay to check out what had been labeled as a great dining experience.Great Mexican food in SG ? Is such a thing even possible ? Let me preface this by saying that not only have I been fortunate enough to dine on freshly caught fish from the Sea of Cortez at out of the way eateries in Baja California Sur, but also, I'm an aficionado of Mexican food, with a number of fantastic recipes under my own belt. In other words, I'm picky about Mexican food. Very.Well, the reviewers weren't wrong. This place is indeed great. The setting is very pleasant and the ambience is too. I will warn you though and say that it was a bit difficult to find for us. I will also say that hailing a taxi from anywhere around this location at 11 PM on a friday night was a bit like banging your head against a brick wall.Back to the dining experience. It started with a bit of a misstep on the part of the hostess, who greeted and seated us with something less than aplomb, but we were undeterred, particularly because every staff member we dealt with afterward was warm, friendly and totally pro.We arrived at 9 PM, super hungry after a very tough day, and in need of starters and cocktails. The drink list is extensive and the cocktails creative. My blood orange margarita was awesome. My boyfriend found his mojito good, but nothing to write home about. The starters, , were divine (a small portion that was just enough to quell the loud grumbling from our tummies.I ordered two tacos (Baja fish and vegetales) and truly, they were things of beauty that were prepared in such a way that while eating them, I didn't make a mess of my hands and clothes. I would mention that I've been hard pressed to find a decent fish taco in SG. For some reason, most restaurants seem to serve these awful creations filled with fried, battered fish. Perhaps they are unaware that in Mexico, fish is not battered before placing it in a taco (actually, Mexican's really don't batter fish at all). But this one was authentic, and very evocative of the Baja peninsula. My boyfriend had tacos de carnitas and said they were delicious. But perhaps my favourite thing was my side order of beets, which were spicy, unusual and, frankly, out-of-this-world. My boyfriend ordered a side dish of rice and it was a lot larger than we expected (definitely enough for two people). For us, the rice was the only less-than-bright spot in the meal because we found it quite dry and too salty.Overall, this was a really enjoyable (though not cheap) night out and we would definitely return and highly recommend.One thing I would mention is that Super Loco REALLY needs some attention to its website, which has some of the slowest page loading times I've ever encountered. It should be aware that people don't really have a whole lot of patience, and if it takes too long to find the info they're looking for, they may well be turned away. Moreover, the content doesn't load well, e.g., loading the menu is hit-or-miss
4
Mexican inspired food with tacos, ceviche, and breakfast items like heuvos rancheros, plus a variety of mexican inspired granola etc. For brunch, a great atmosphere, but the staff is sometimes overwhelmed with the busy times -- sometimes a request (menu/water/bill etc.) is almost immediate, and sometimes you need to ask 3 or 4 times before they remember. Overall, a nice atmosphere and good choice for a brunch
4
Came here over the weekend and immediately the host greeted us with such a friendly manner and was very patience with how indecisive I was on seating arrangementsOnce seated, I ordered the Sweetcorn fritter while my boyfriend ordered the crepesMy sweetcorn fritter was amazing! We actually already had little breakfast prior to coming to Super Loco, but I still managed to finish off the whole plate! The crepes were of course,, gone within few seconds after it got to the table!Overall we had a really nice brunch and we will definitely come back on our next trip to Singapore! Thanks for being awesome
4
Randomly decided to try this place on a Monday night recently and was quite impressed. Food was really good..beat pulled pork I've had and the service was amazing!! Right from the entrance to finding us a table of 7 (we had two kids with us) to us leaving we were given fantastic service. My only negative comment would be that it was a tad expensive and servings were small so we had to order quite a bit but the 10bucks margaritas on Mondays are really worth it!! Great buzz and music too!
4
Food comes close to Mexican but didn't feel adventurous enough - the flavors still seemed to light and mild. Having just returned form Mexico...I have a good idea of how awesome Mexican cuisine is and how utterly under rated it is. I love the tuna ceviche, guacs, fish taco, pork taco at this resto. The corn is sweet and juicy, the corn chips are crisp and fresh too - quite a change from many places. The coconut ceviche was very average.Nice ambience facing the river
5
Great Mexican food. Possibly the best we've ever had. And we've had our fair share.Cocktails were awesome. Staff were extremely attentive and friendly.Food was served very quickly. A few other reviews make mention of this as a negative (i.e. it's all pre-cooked etc etc) but it makes sense the fillings would be cooked in bulk and then dishes 'assembled' upon ordering. I don't particularly care as it was freaking delicious and we got it quickly.Had it as our final dinner in Singapore; seriously contemplated returning the following day for lunch before heading to the airport
4
Visited twice; once for brunch and once for dinner. If you are a first-timer here, I highly recommend visiting for the dinner service. The menu is twice as extensive as the lunch one, and then some!Lunch is pretty basic - burritos, eggs, beans. Dinner comes with tacos! Who does not want tacos?Get a platter to share, and try to Surprise Taco of the day! Also recommended: lamb quesadilla/tostadita
2
We were recommended this place by our Singapore expat friends but I didn't rate it - the service was good but the food was very oily and very small. I guess you are paying for the location and the novelty of Mexican food in Asia.
5
This is one of my favourite haunts. Great tacos (I recommend the chorizo and the lamb), the ceviche is fresh and tasty, corn is a taste sensation, passionfruit smashitos are way too drinkable... Always a great night out!
3
The food came way too fast, it can only mean that it's all pre-cooked and just popped on a plate as soon as it's ordered. While the quality was ok it was not what I was expecting and I left disappointed and hungry.
3
We were walking along the Quayside and decided to try this restaurant / bar. The hostess was very helpful and arranged a table for us quickly (A couple), even though the restaurant was very busy.The drinks order was taken and delivered promptly and we placed our food order. The waitress explained that most of the mains were served as tapas size, so we ordered a couple each and shared them. The quality of the food was good and the size of the portions were adequate, allowing for the explanation about tapas size. We also ordered a jug of sangria which was delivered quickly, but there did not appear to be very much wine, mostly mixer, fruit and ice
5
After hearing great reviews of the place from a number of people, I visited Super Loco with high expectations, which it completely lived up to. Between two of us- we ordered two appetizers (Mago Ceviche and Snapper Tostaditas) and Spiced Roasted Chicken Enchiladas, all of which very yummy. The place has a great ambience as well and I was surprised to see it that crowded on a Monday evening. All in all, would totally recommend the place
2
This may just be one of the most terribly overpriced and least tasty mexican food i have ever eaten in my life. Whatever we ordered was super super super small in size and was truly flavorless. From the tacos to the mains ( we ordered about 7 or 8 different plates between us) so that should have provided a fair representation of variety too! 1 ok, the rest very bad. The most disappointing dish was the flavorless tacos. Im not sure how all these reviews came about so well
5
I've been to Super Loco several times and the food keeps getting better and better. Their tacos are my absolute favourite - they're the perfect size and they're packed with flavour. For a delicious bite sized treat, try the Tostaditas - the Pescado (piquillo and coconut cured wild snapper, avo, chilli) is my favourite. Yum!They've recently revamped their menu and some stand out dishes for me include the Almeja Pulpo A La Vercruzana (grilled octopus) and the Cerdo en Nogada (spice rubbed pork fillet). Don't forget to check out their new Dessert menu. It's hard for me to pick just one to recommend because they're all so tasty, but if you want a fresh, light end to your meal, try the pina al horno (roast pineapple) Highly recommended for Brunch and Dinner
5
We went to this place on Sunday for brunch. We had to wait for a table of 5, this only took about 15 minutes. The staff are friendly the place it self was packed with families, couples and some singles. The menu is not extensive but I defy anyone not to find something they like. I had their version of egg benedict and it was delicious and filling. I would like to go back for an evening meal.
5
Went to singapore for a short vacation and came across this place near the river... tried the food for lunch and ended up going back for dinner and lunch the next day and dinner again!.. simple and straightforward not pretentious! Lamb quesadilla is a winner, the tuna tartare was epic paired with their wide selection of mexican beer! highly recommended and will always come visit whenever i am in singapore! oh and not to forget the chefs were really cool aswel!
5
This is my second visit and I must say it way surpassed my first visit's experience We had ordered the recommendations by our such a lovely lady chip salsa guac, mango cevice salad, crab and pulled pork tosdata , the tacos red grilled snapper , beef cheeks main course was ancho steak and pork ribs . The food's quality was good. We ordered sangria as well. The mood in the restaurant was good. We were promptly served by the server I don't know is she a waitress or a manager as she is the only lady wearing black shirt and if I could recall her name is sha-sha . She made us feel very at home. Checking from time to time whether we are good and clearing our plates in a timely and non-intrusive manner. She is very quick to react when asked for service. Thumbs up for the food and service! Definitely a great dining experience and a significant improvement from my first visit

Great Mexican food in the heart of Robertson Quay, with awesome service to guide you through the menu and the options.
3
It's a place you want to party at. Nice atmosphere and even better tequila cocktails. Pity that the kitchen closes at 10.30pm.
Excellent service.
Then why the 3? I could not be there l long enough to give it a 4.

Steak burrito was the superstar on the menu. Ordered it every time without looking. Beware the corn ice cream. Worst dessert ever eaten anywhere in the world.
5
It was like I found hidden gem in Singapore. The restaurant was cute and got really great ambience. People were very nice also funny.

So!. Wanna visit with friends and the maitre d (c'mon this is not New York) suggests they have a table but if she has a demand for a bigger table we should expect to be moved. The place is not busy. M'd needs a reality check and a lesson in customer service. Then we are ready to order. The same service person says it's not her job to take an order.Customer service 1-0-1. You need customers survive.! treat them well and they will be the backbone of your business. This place slips on the customer service side big time

Best brunch place in Singapore :) Mexican chef, Mario rocks!!!We are a big big fun of this place. They serve really good dinner as well. Lively atmosphere. "No service charge" is great. In Singapore, 90% of restaurants charges 10% extra for their poor services and that always make us feel ripped off. However Super Loco doesn't have service charge yet their service is generally good although can be better.Overall, their food is really good and reasonably priced so worth going back many times

I am blessed with friends who are insanely talented in cooking so much so that they inspire me to sometimes dwell to fine art of making food. I also am blessed with friends who of late are bringing their A game to Singapore making "eating out" not just a chore to fill your stomachs, but an event to enjoy the experience. Be it cocktails, drinks or food. My friends Christian and Julian have expanded their repertoire of all things they love about Mexico to add this eatery. Easy ambiance and atmosphere, mouth water goodies and really really good margarita. As one would expect from initial teething issues, once they found the rhythm and groove it started to fall in place. And thus enjoying good food and drinks at Super Loco is pretty much all you can do. Am I biased? Sure! I am after all supporting my friends who want to ensure you eat well and enjoy your food

In a very short space of time Super Loco has opened and developed a loyal and strong mid week and weekend following. Rightly so - it appeals to all age brackets and occasions and the service is at a different level to almost every bar/restaurant in Singapore and on a par with high end 200+ per head establishments. Never been a huge fan of Mexican food as a Brit but super loco has fresh expertly created dishes and the seasoning always hits the spot. We go weekly for Sunday lunch and are very happy that a restaurant of super loco opened a short walking distance from our condo. The team are fantastic with small kids as well. The portion sizes previous reviewers have mentioned are not with any foundation I am a Welshman with a large appetite and never had any issues.

We called in to have a couple of happy hour drinks which were $8 each for a beer and a frozen margarita. We chose a taco each for a meal, they were so small, 3 bites and gone. I was gone soon after $40, for that effort was very average
5
I had a true touch of luck in exploring a little further along the Robertson Quay selection of restaurants one evening. This remarkable mexican restaurant is just past Boom-a-Rang and has the best and friendliest service I have seen in Singapore. The food is colourful; well presented and of course tastes amazing. Ask the staff for ideas about combinations and also sides to put with your mains. I had a great vegetarian meal there and was pleasantly stuffed at the end.12 out of 10 !
4
Decided to drop by about 5. Ordered a couple of margaritas. Chips came 30 minutes later. The Guacamole was worth the wait. But the margaritas were average and so was the service.
4
Had dinner at Super Loco after a crazy party day !!! The chips and salsa was awesome ... Guacamole was okay. The chorizo tacos were awesome and so were he quesadillas ! Good vibe .. Great feel !
2
OK - so not that expensive for Singapore but the tacos were very small and you would need a few of them to make a meal. Tacos were OK but not that much better than I can make at home.
3
The Mexican Street Food concept is good fun, but don't expect large portions. So if you are a big eater and love Mexican food there are better restaurants for you. Having said that, the atmosphere and location on the pedestrianized Robinson Quay make this a great venue for drinks and snack
3
For the price you have to pay, the servings are quite small and not that tasty.The service on the other hand was great
5
We had a big group so we were lucky enough to try almost everything on the menu. I loved everything, including the frozen margaritas. Great selection of food and varied tastes. Some imitation Mexican restaurants the food all ends up tasting the same, but this place has a great variety to suit all tastes. With the exception of vegetarians, where there was a limited selection for the one in our group.This area is also really nice, away from the main tourist drag of Clarke Quay, but still on the waterfront. After your meal you can easily step over to many of the bars in the surrounding area
3
The food portions are small, the prices high, reflecting poor value for what it is. Street food? Definitely not. Food is good without being great, the staff were very hit and miss, and the it was not that busy the night we were there. Atmosphere is good, very happening place gives you the impression that this will be a good venue, unfortunately we were all a bit disappointed with this visit.Get one of the inside tables to get out of the heat, although the place is open plan out to the boardwalk, there are big aircon units inside that do a very good job of keeping the place cool
4
Great cocktails, good Mexican food, friendly staff and nice Mexican atmosphere. Very well located along the river. The menu is extensive and we adored most of the stuff we ate. We didn't have room left for a dessert which was a shame. Will definitely go there again.
2
I felt ripped off after leaving Super Loco. We had lunch with friends and while quite a few items were already finished (like the avocados!!) the food we settled on was super small and super expensive.I had to order a second main which was the pork bun because I was still hungry. If you are happy to spend $30 for two small buns filled with pork, this is the place for you.I don't know why a restaurant like this feels the need to rip off its customers??
5
Visited Super Loco countless times. Greeted with smiles from staffs each time i dine in. Vibrant,cooling,relaxing,chilling resto. Food marvellous excellent. Will always order their corn as well as casadilla ( which i recommend ) Along with their dessert,caramel popcorn ice cream ( i think ) & churros. The atmosphere thats full of energy,music thats upbeat and it just complete your day totally.
4
I had a total of 11 in the party. I opted for a set which worked very well. The must try is the corn. Was a great dining experience and the service excellent. I would definitely return. Am a big fan of chef mArio's choices.
3
we were a group of 5 and we ordered the wings, chips, ceviche, corn, 3 types of taco and beef n chicken quesadilla. the wings was the only one we all didn't like. the beef cheek tacos was marvelous. the fish so so n the lamb was not bad. the quesadilla was not bad n the corn was amazing. it had some smelly cheese sprinkled on top but the taste went very well together.we also had the churros and it was good. will retur
1
I went for the Saturday brunch and was very excited to try the huevos rancheros. For $18 bucks I figured I'd get a decent brunch that would fill me up. Two tiny rubbery tortillas with a fried egg and thimble full of refried beans does not constitute huevos rancheros. The $16 Bloody Maria was ok, but it certainly didn't make me forget the tiny breakfast that would have left a squirrel hungry. You know it's not worth it if you have to go somewhere else to eat afterwards. Shameful
3
We had passed Super Loco several times on way home at night and thought we must go there before we leave, We thought they would be open for lunch but several times they were closed, They seem to be open on the weekend for brunch.The service was very good and the style was cool and colourful.I was hoping for Lunch as it was about 2pm and was looking forward to something along the lines of a Burrito or Enchilada, I know Mexican cuisine is so much more, but that's what I wanted, We found out you could only order Breakfast.I must say in the 9 days we were in Singapore this was the meal I was lest satisfied with, which surprised both my partner and niece as they enjoyed theirs.When we return to Singapore next year I will go back but at night to try their dinner menu
4
Dined with two friends on a Friday night and the place was buzzing - great vibe. We had jugs of margaritas (NOT cheap in Singapore!) and many dishes. The pulled pork was amazing and the fish tacos. The Pice de Gallo wasn't made quite right we thought
4
Dined here last Saturday for brunch with my family. We ordered esquites, huevos rancheros and churros for food. Flat white and orange pineapple and ginger juice for drinks. The esquites was nice and refreshing with lime mayo, cheese and chili. The huevos rancheros had two sunny side on top of corn tortilla with tomato salsa and guacamole. This dish was not bad but the food plating was poor. The Mexican beans were under the tortilla and rest of the items were all over the dish. The churros were good. Nice texture, crispy and soft. Subtly dusted with cinnamon and brown sugar. The drinks were refreshing. Wish they had more variety in the brunch menu.Food was reasonably priced and the service was great
4
We had a great time at Superloco with its very friendly and organised staff. The place was buzzing with a really nice atmosphere. The Tostadas de Cerdo Pibil was the standout dish of the night. The pulled pork on it was simply to die for. Full of flavour and melting in the mouth. The sweet corn ice-cream with salted caramel popcorn was another favourite of mine and I could eat the chargrilled corn cobs all day. The drinks menu is more than extensive and the cocktails different and exciting. Owner Julian Tan was super passionate about his restaurant and shared an exciting news that one of the founders from Melbourne's hottest Mexican restaurants, Mamasita, will be joining Super Loco soon. Already, they've lured their ex head-chef, Scott Eddington, over so I'm sure they're working on more new yummy Mexican fare. Can't wait to be back

Great MEXICAN experience even though we entered when it was last order. The ambience was very warm and inviting and seemed very lively. Really good place to hang out as well.Great variety of food for veg & nonveg.We tried most of the dishes and they were excellent in taste and preparation.Will come here again.Must try:Beef Quesadellabeef tacosveg tacossalmon & avocado dip with nachosbeef starte
5
Visiting on a Friday evening, it was filled with a lively crowd enjoying the end of a work week. Menu is designed for sharing. Ours was a party of 4 and we shared 7 dishes. Flavours a fresh and zingy. Tacos, dips, corn etc. All beautifully presented and tasty. Drinks are nice and cold and overall, its a great place to hang out. We also visited a few days later for breakfast. Both times, we found the service to be very quick and friendly.

Dined here on 5 October 2014 with two other families (party of 11, 4 of whom were kids under 10) and we had a great experience. We showed up for dinner about 6:30 and were seated in an area which allowed the young kids to explore the river walk while still being close enough to the parents if needed. Wait staff was friendly and attentive, impressive given that we were a larger crowd with somewhat rowdy children in tow. We started with chips and salsa/guac and a round of drinks. For entrees our favourites were the Taco de Barbacoa and Taco de Chorizo. The tacos are sold as a single 6-inch soft tortilla, so if you have a big appetite you will want to order multiple tacos to get your fill. Price per entree is not out of line with other establishments (after all, is anything inexpensive in Singapore?) however value-wise we rate it average since many will likely feel one 6-inch taco is not enough to satisfy their hunger, so you end up ordering multiples. We enjoyed the food and will be back again since it is a convenient walk from our condo
4
Great choice of cocktails, really nice street food type meals and a nice location by the river. Well worth a visit if you don't want a formal meal.
4
This is a place with a good vibe, the music is cool and eclectic, the staff is very friendly, but food ranges from excellent to mediocre. My favorites are ceviche de mango and taco de pescado, even if I find it a bit overpriced for the quantity served... The brunch menu is very limited and the food to choose from is average... I tried most of the things available but didn't find anything worth it. One good point, it is open on sunday evenings.A little effort on the food with more reasonable prices will only make the place one of the best spots in Robertson quay

Super Loco is another over-priced restaurant serving up grub inspired by someone's travels elsewhere. Mexican street food, well the food doesn't taste at all authentic, but the portions are very close in size to real street food in Mexico. Value-wise its over-priced when consider price to the size and quality. Ok so its not authentic and another over-priced restaurant in Singapore, but can it someone be justified with the taste of the food. Sorry it fails there too. Went with a group of friends so was able to try pretty much every tostada, taco, quesadilla and a few of the cerviches. Unfortunately out of everything tasted there wasn't anything that would make me want to come back. The cerviches were the biggest disappointment. Cerviche is about seafood, unfortunately that was the one thing you won't taste. Snapper and mango, ok whatever, but shouldn't the mango compliment the snapper and not over power it. The quesadillas are a wreck, too many ingredients going off in their own direction trying to be held together with melted cheese. Would stay away from the pork tostada unless you want something that probably tastes the least like Mexican food on the menu. It's something more akin to bak kwa on toast. In fact, there is probably a more sweet note rather than spice note in most all the dishes. The chorizo tacos might be the closet thing to authentic, but that said some people around the table thought they tasted funny to them. Either of the fish tacos might be worth a try, but fish tacos aren't for everyone. Enchiladas should be smothered with a gravy sauce, but the chicken enchiladas here aren't, instead have a teaspoon amount of green salsa splashed on the top. That's unfortunate cause perhaps this dish could have the makings of something decent, although trying to recall if have ever had enchiladas from a street vendors cart before. Leave the best for last - the service was great. Very attentive, orders came out lightening quick, as was the service to remove empty plates
2
We visited at 3pm on a Sunday and had 15 minutes to choose something from the brunch/breakfast menu before the kitchen closed. The options were limited - chicken and pork tostas (burgers) were standout although far from what we were seeking from a mexican restaurant. Beers were $14+, no happy hour. We opted for both tostas which are about the size of a Big Mac. After running out of food we paid $12 for some salsa and guacamole then moved onto the nearby thai restaurant who's kitchen is open all day. Not really sure what they're trying to achieve with their rigid dining concept.

Have been to the sister property Lucha Loco in Duxton Hill and although loved the ambience didn't really rate the food. So I was interested to try the new addition to the group. Definitely an improvement and would go back. We went for Brunch and was pleasantly surprised. Food delicious and decent serving size. The juices are yum as is the Sangria.
3
To be fair to Super Loco, I would need to return for dinner but for the time being, my experience was limited to Sunday brunch. The ambience was cheery and by the waterside, the staff friendly and helpful. Food wise it was ok, I ate the sweecorn fritters with sunny side up eggs, sour cream and gucamole. Also pinched some of my companions pork torta which contained pulled pork in a bun. We split the signature dessert of blue corn cake with whipped cream and some agave nectar. It made for a change from the run of the mill brunch places but would need another visit to see if this is a place I'd come back to
2
I was excited to try this relatively new Mexican restaurant, which is in a great location. Unfortunately, it's just another one of Singapore's over-priced food establishments with fair food and bad service. I had the taco de pescado, which wasn't too bad except for two things:1) I told the waiter at least three times that i hate mayo and asked him to put the sauce on the side, and it came our with the sauce on top, and 2) it is so small that you eat it in 3-4 bites. The margaritas are pricey and end up being about 3 tablespoons of liquid after all of the ice that they put in the glass. The salsas were actually pretty good, but you can only eat so much chips and salsa. They will do fine with the tourist business because of the location, but I will not be returning, nor will I recommend it to any of my friends

We had our New Year's Eve early dinner at Super Loco, a relatively new restaurant on Robertson Quay. Great open space with inside and outside seating though this time of year there is no difference. Service was attentive, friendly and effective.The food was interesting, unique and fresh. We are vegetarian and are used to going out to eat Mexican and seeing a broad set of options. There are a number of options available. We tried most of them in our part of 5. They were all very good. The margaritas, of which I tried several, were creative and balanced, not too sweet, not too sour. The chips and accompanying dips were excellent, with just the right amount of spice. Only thing missing for us was a spicy cheese dip...but it was a very minor item.We were glad we tried this. Recommend you do to
4
Been seeing the photos of their brunch offerings in my Facebook feed and have been meaning to try it. I tempered my expectations as photos always have a way of bloating one's expectations. We ordered The Big Mexican and was not disappointed! Piled up the beans, avocado and fresh tomatoes over the toasted sourdough bread - yum! The subtle sweetness of quinoa and Chia pot balanced the savoury big mex dish. Definitely coming back
2
First of all, I've been to Lucho Loco and Super Loco many times for dinner and drinks and I know the deal - food and booze at twice the price of what you might think reasonable - but excellent quality so worth once in a while or for special occasions. However, I can't say the same for the brunch at Super Loco.First of all, there is none of the usual menu items, but instead a "special" brunch menu. This is a shame because the normal menu is so good and that's what we came for. We ordered four "tortas" (a pretentious name for a sandwich) as that seemed like the best option. My fish sandwich came first and consisted of two small pieces of grilled fish stuffed between a small stale roll with some guac and beans on it and accompanied by a few slices of jalapeÃ±os and a sliver (literally a sliver) of carrot on the side. The chicken sandwiches were no better and nobody could even finish. So to summarize, a limited choice of options, the torta bread was stale (or dry and tasteless but what's the difference), the portion size was unacceptably small (even my 10 year old was still hungry), and the price was still high. We also saw an order of huevos go by and they looked equally unimpressive. I don't mind "overpriced but worth it" once in a while, but there is no excuse for expensive and not worth it. Furthermore, it's strange that the owners can get dinner so right but brunch sooooo wrong. I won't be going back.
4
The atmosphere in the restaurant is really great and the food is quite good as well. I really enjoyed the blood orange margarita. Did think it was slightly expensive though but I guess relative to other places in Singapore its not too bad.
5
And the location by the quai is superb. We were welcomed by Julien, the senior partner. The food is exceptional and reasonably priced for Singapore standards at this location. It is best to order a variety and share family style. We had Tostada Tuna & Beef, Elotes corn on the cob, beef & chicken quesadilla, Tacos barbacoa beef and Baja Fish.Menu is extensive comprising delicious tacos as a specialty. Consider these as excellent tapas or snacks to go with your drinks. You are not eating at a Food Centre of 50 take out places, so you pay for gourmet style service. The servers are well trained, the chef is doing a great job.The music is great and the place is a buzz. The establishment does not add a service charge, so you tip as generously as you are served.It was indeed a memorable evening. Would recommend the place any day and we will go again
4
The younger sibling of Duxton Hill's Lucha Loco, this buzzing Mexican restaurant is a welcome addition to the Robertson Quay dining scene. Open for dinner as well as weekend brunch, the place is very popular, so I'd advise booking ahead if you're in a big group (although they have a great system to text you if you put your name down for a table while you go elsewhere for a drink).Having spent a lot of time in Mexico, I can confirm the food is pretty good! Great ceviche, tuna tostadas, and the blood orange margaritas are great to wash it all down with. Perfect place for a lively dinner with friends. Enjoy
3
This was our second time we attempted to visit Super Loco, first time it was a 30 minute wait for a seat. Second time we managed to get a seat, sad that they do not take reservations. We walk by quite frequently and it is always packed in the evenings. The atmosphere is very lively, the servers are friendly. But the alcohol and food feels to be over priced for what you get. The cocktails are very good with 'Mexican twists' of classics, like the Mexican Mule. Chips, salsa and guacamole are very good but is not a value for money deal, at around $13 for a portion you do not get enough.I was looking forward to the tacos, but disappointed to not see any carne asada or any simple meat, onion, clinatro and sauce style. The pork one I was tired was too overloaded on the meat when it could have come with three tortillas instead of the two, and split the meat evenly.Overall, I was glad I visited the outlet but I wouldn't go back anytime soon
4
We just arrived in Singapore from Sydney and was looking for a quick feed.We stumbled across this restaurant and was made very welcome.The service was very good the waiters kept topping up our glasses of water even when the glass was 1/2 empty.Food was superb, pricing was comparable & the atmosphere was great
3
You have to eat the corn. Just order the corn. Fish tacos is not bad. Sangria is nice, a bit sweet, but expensive, $55 for a jug. Didn't fancy anything else
2
Went there with my family and expected Mexican food but this is not typical Mexican food. This is bad street food. Bad taste in everything we tried (4different tacos ,children's quesadillas,guacamole) ,overpriced tiny portions, very few dishes to choose and nothing really for kids (only corn or one quesadilla!!) . The atmosphere is very nice ,service was good but we are not going there again for food.
1
Chose Super Loco for a Saturday night drinks outing with a group of friends, and it was a terrible mistake. Service was slow, taking about 20 minutes just to serve us our beverages when the place wasn't even packed with customers at 11pm. When the drinks finally arrived, they were awful - the jug of sangria tasted more like a diluted version of cheap grape juice and the pina colada was weak and tasted like expired pineapple juice. Seemed like there were barely any alcohol content in our drinks! Shocking, and an absolute waste of money
4
I have a personal dread of the Tex-Mex fare that passes in Singapore for Mexican food.1001 things to do with guacamole,sour cream and refried beans is the usual theme. I was therefore very fortunate to be invited to the soft opening of Super Loco on Saturday lunch time and to discover what a revelation good authentic Mexican street food is.To start with the decor is colourful,fresh,light and airy with large seating capacity but neatly sectioned so you never feel isolated and just as good, no Mariachi music but cool background beats creating a chilled out atmosphere.The brunch menu was necessarily limited but had some great offerings so we tucked into the steak burrito with pico de gallo & spicy salsa,the corn fritters,barramundi and the blue corn cake with mezcal cream. Let's just say if this is Mexican street food those guys eat really well and the drinks were equally flavoursome and impressed also. Have to say though that for me the mezcal was the cherry on my cake being authentic and the 'good stuff'. I must also mention the staff here who are clearly enjoying their work and it shows in their attitude being super friendly,funny and generally engaging as well as very good at their jobs. As you can tell I loved this place & will definitely being going back,again and again.Of course they do dinner here with a much expanded menu so that's my next stop but for a Saturday lunch time,this was a real find. One last comment, the prices are very very reasonable.As they say 'Contra todo mal,mezcal' (to remedy all life's ills mezcal

Super Loco is the new mexican restaurant by the Lucha Loco group, located by the river at Robertson Quay. The restaurant has a bit more airy feel. The reservation policy remains the same, can only reserve for 8 people or more; but I've found it easier to find seating here than at Lucha Loco. The food here is good, very different from the fare you find at most other mexican places, they do have quesidillas and probably burritos (not sure) but you'd probably not want to eat those as you'd surely want to try their soft shell tacos, each quite unique. Also try their pork ribs and the corn is a must. I have only tried their sangria, because the first time I had one I quite liked it and ever since have been drinking only those. Service was prompt, though the lady taking my order forgot (or probably didn't catch) our order of their wonderful corn on the cob.The negatives (and the 4 starts) are the pricing for what is considered street food, slightly on the higher side and the seating can be a bit more spaced out. But if you are ok to drop a few $s, go to this place for good and unique (at least in SG) Mexican food
5
Impeccable ! The ambience is always filled with energy. The best Mexican street food in Singapore and their margaritas is a must try. With superb service from an amazing team of staff who is highly attentive & friendly. This is the place to be.
4
The place is decently sized and the atmosphere is quite relaxing. Surprisingly so with the good choice of music. It is a fusion restaurant and some of the Mexican dishes are a bit "weird" for me. One thing for sure they got the octopus ceviche and margarita spot on. The margarita is not too sweet and not too strong. The alcohol doesn't go down burning your throat and stomach but you can definitely taste it. Service was fantastic. They were very attentive and was fast. I think at some point I felt like the food were coming too fast that I got confused. :)I would definitely come here for a casual gathering with friends for some more of the best margarita in town paired with the octopus ceviche. YUM
5
Great place for chilling out with friends, a date night, and even a first-date place. Upon reaching the place, my friends and I were not just greeted by the staff, but the managerial staff as well who promptly led us to a smaller table to sit down first while preparing the bigger table for 5 people for us. Despite being full-house on a Saturday night, I was already impressed with the initial prompt service and the attentiveness of the staff. Within 2-3 minutes, we had our bigger table cleaned up and all ready for us to move over. The ambiance of the place is amazing - from the decoration of the place down to minute details such as the choice of music which was not too loud and allowed decent conversations to take place, the staff were also prompt in taking our orders as well. All these details had already made a great first impression of Super Luco being a great restaurant to dine at, but of course, the food is still what makes the icing on the cake. Super Luco has the best margaritas in town in my honest opinion - we ordered the traditional lime frozen margaritas and were immediately blown away by it. My friends and I could not stop drinking it through the night. Then came the food where we ordered nachos, beef/lamb/fish tacos, ceviches, octopus aspargo, a cream cheese chilli wrap - but the dish that we unanimously agreed was the highlight of the night was the Arrachera con chile anco - which was a grilled, succulent steak done to a perfect medium rare. Not only was it cut up to bite-size, but the tenderness remained up to every single last bite of it. We could tell that attention to detail was made in the dining kitchen as well for all these dishes, and our tummies were more than satisfied with them, which equated to us having a really great Saturday night. :) Best part was we had not just the ground, but also the managerial staff making their trips over to us periodically to ensure that our dining experience was going well.Overall, it was a really great experience at Super Luco, and I'm definitely coming back to bring my other friends to have the same dining experience as I did. Not a place to pass up for sure

Great place for a chill spot to get together with friends for great and fresh (emphasis on the fresh) Mexican food.The ambience of the place is comfortable with a causal buzz filled with laughter and chatter. It was a fun vibe and good spot for an extended meal and the swapping of stories.The food was excellent, broken up in generally either share options (eg. ceviches, quesadillas, etc) and for solo munching (eg. Tacos, try the Baja fish taco for bit of fried crunchiness). The 1 thing that jumps out at you is the freshness of the ingredients, guacamole with fresh chopped avocados, mojitos with fresh lime wedges. A lot of emphasis is in the food prepped to make sure that the food does not feel like you are eating refried anything. The signature dish I would recommend is the Arrachera con chile ancho, a grilled skirt steak rubbed with ancho chili. The done-ness of the steak was an excellent medium, a deep pink with a nice chew to it.The service was also above average, the wait staff was always on their toes and keeping an eye out on the tables. Even the managerial team (I'm assuming they are the managerial team, the were not wearing uniforms) was keeping and eye on tables and were not sheepish in stepping in to make sure the dining experience was going at a smooth clip.Overall, the experience was great. Great food and drink paired with a causal comfortable environment makes this dining experience both fresh and lively
5
If you go to Super Loco you can't mess up! Its the best mexican food in Singapore. The chicken quesadillas, corn, the ceviches, the churros,etc every single meal is tasty. YUM! Super Loco has amazing cocktails. My favorite one is the mexican mule and if you are in the party mood get their special tequila shot! The atmosphere is great and the staff super friendly. Every time I go there I have a fantastic time
5
The atmosphere and setting is really beautiful. It's Mexican with a modern funky twist. The food came on time and turns out really tasty. I had a banana cake for dessert and.. muah! Good stuff. Besides that it seems like a super cool place to chill and have drinks. On the plus side, I think the waiters (and of course waitresses) manages huge crowds well. Gotta give it to em'. 5/5
4
Usually make it to Lucha Loco when we are in Singapore but friends recommended the new restaurant for Mexican Street Food - Super Loco. Wow, what a great place. Seems to be the hot spot to go in Singapore at the moment - went on a Thursday night and it was buzzing with people and atmosphere. Ordered the snapper ceviche which was delicious, the Baja fish taco and the lamb taco - both super tasty, and the churros - I love.! There were 2 of us and we spent around $50 each including a drink, so think it was decent value for tasty food, good margaritas and a fun and lively dinner. There is outdoor seating near the river, which was great
2
The food quality was reasonable, albeit run of the mill Mexican. We ordered a starter and 2 mains, all 3 of which arrived at the same time. The portion sizes were embarrassingly small (and glaringly uncorrelated with the prices) that we were trying to eat slowly. The wait staff tried to take our unfinished dishes away 4x within the space of 3 minutes, and didn't offer to refill our water once. We felt genuinely rushed, like they were herding cows and ringing the cash register. They don't charge for service at the restaurant, and as such were enthusiastic, but obviously not focused on the right things

Been to Super Loco many times since its opening simply because it is amazing. In terms of food, authentic mexican food in Singapore doesn't get any better than here. Having been to Mexico for holiday, I dare say the food at Super Loco could even be better than some of the places I dined at whilst there. Favourites on the menu are the ancho steak - cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious, beef cheek taco, and the churros with homemade chocolate sauce. As for cocktails I really like the cancun cooler.Atmosphere is brilliant, the restaurant is amply spacious but always a full house on any day of the week. Celebrated a friend's birthday there once on a Friday, and the staff came out donning luchadore masks giving shooters to everyone in the restaurant. Other diners also chimed in on the birthday song - an overall very entertaining dining experience

I highly recommend this place. It is lively, has a great crowd, and like Lucha Loco the tastiest Mexican food ever! My favourite is always the Baja Fish Taco.... I crave this every time i am away from Singapore. And their margaritas are the best in town. Well done Super Loco!

Awesome ambience, delicious tacos, and well priced drinks. My girlfriends and I were pleasantly surprised at how well managed everything was even on a busy night!

Finally decent Mexican food in Robertson Quay! Been waiting for a decent food option to open up in this neighborhood, and thank god it was the boys from Lucha Loco who have opened another stunning venue in Super Loco. Yes, They did it again to our great delight !!! The tastiest Mexican food ever, and well-priced cocktails. I always order the Chicken Quesadilla which is yummy. I will be back

There's not nearly enough restaurants in Singapore that offer great food, quality service and a fun atmosphere. It might be the tequila talking but Super Loco ticked all these boxes for me. My guests had just been to Mexico for their honeymoon and they were blown away by this place. Our favourites were the snapper ceviche, the grilled skirt steak and the Paloma cocktails.  Guaranteed good times and the place to bring friends visiting SG. Highly Recommended!

My first visit to Super Loco was just after opening, loved it and have been back several times. Super Loco has a lot of open space, excellent atmosphere and located right by the river. The music is a good mix of latin, Mexican and other music that matches the vibe.They have a drink that's like a margarita but with grapefruit juice. Excellent - try it out. The frozen margaritas are also good and they have Dos Equis beer which for me is much better than corona. The staff are super friendly and although there was a few minor menu knowledge gaps on my first visit, they've clearly been fixed because last nights service was outstanding. The food is so damn good. The beef cheek taco is so tasty and the presentation is cool. The corn is the best I have had. All my friends went for the churros for dessert but I'm hooked on the caramel corn ice cream. Never had that before but will order it every visit. I've travelled to a lot of places (several times to Mexico) and I have to say Super Loco has nailed it. You can go here with the family, with friends or with business partners. It's really a great spot that I highly recommend

The best fish taco in town, super delish! Love the corn too, a must-have on the menu. And make sure you save space for the desserts, the Churros, served warm with chocolate & raspberry sauce are out of this world! So many yummy cocktails to try too, my fav is The Paloma which is a refreshing alternative to the usual Margarita. One of the best spots in town for sure - has a really fun vibe & nice buzz , very airy & cool, "shabby chic" decor is comfy and it really is perfect for a casual night out with friends. Very rare for Singapore to have one place that has it all, Super Loco does

Friends recommended Super Loco on my recent trip to Singapore, and wow what a great place. Seems to be the hot spot to go in Singapore at the moment - went on a Thursday night and it was buzzing with people and atmosphere. Ordered the snapper ceviche which was delicious, the Baja fish taco and the lamb taco - both super tasty, and the churros for dessert are a must order! There were 2 of us and we spent around $50 each including a drink, so think it was decent value for tasty food, good margaritas and a fun and lively dinner. Try get a seat near the front, closer to the river for great people watching .  Have been to Lucha Loco which I love. Super Loco has a different menu, but just as good

Happy days when I found out Lucha Loco now has an equally excellent Mexican restaurant sister in Super Loco. I've had plenty of Mexican across the globe and Super Loco is consistently one of the best. The flavours are spot on, the drinks are creative and delicious and the staff always greet with a big, friendly smile and helpful in every way. Best of all is the unique decor and buzzing energy whichever night you visit. Highly recommended!

Prior to moving to Singapore I have been living in the US and have been spoiled with Mexican food from my frequent trips to Cali and Mexico. Therefore when I heard a new Mexican place was opened in town, I was excited to try it out. My experience at Super Loco was a big disappointment. While the place is nice and trendy, the food is really what I cared about. The moment we sat down, my friend and I proceeded to order some drinks and chips and guac. She ordered a horchata and it just tasted someone dumped a whole bunch of cinnamon powder into the glass. My friend sent it back (after explaining how to make it) and they ended up adding a bunch of milk and when we commented it was not right- the waitress came back and told us the bartender said he didn’t know how to make it and will make another drink instead. Really?? The chips and guac came- the chips were stale and the guac was a liquid mess. We ordered enchiladas and it came out soggy and was tasteless. None of the taste blended in together and nothing was flavorful. We also ordered a taco but even now as I’m writing this review, I cant even remember what kind of taco we ordered. The entire meal was unsatisfying, unmemorable, and overpriced! To top of it off, when we got the bill they decided to charge us 3x for the drinks. At least the staff was nice about changing the bill

when we asked a seat looks comfortable, were told it booked. and there were lots of free tables, but they gave us a smallest one. that's all right, but there was nobody to sit the table we preferred until close time. they lied to customers, i don't like it! the menu written by mixed english and spanish, totally rare, how can people understand it? it calls Super Loco, but you will be surprise of their quantity of food, difficult to say "Loco"......we had to ask second time menu, but they brought us the bill......ok.....if only go there for ambiance and beer, it's good choice, but for food, i don't recommend it. the price includes 10% tax, only need to pay 7% service charge

My friends and I went there as one of us had been to their other restaurant in Duxton Hills. This place recently opened. The service is bad (waiters didn't know the menu, got it wrong a few times, were quite disorganized) and the portion sizes are so small! All their tacos should be under the appetizer section of the menu, not as a main dish. The food tasted good, but definitely over-priced for such small portions.We ended up going to another place to get more food. I would wait until they've been opened a bit longer and fixed the issues, as well as increased the portion sizes, before going back. It is a nice location for a drink by the river, but definitely not for dinner
