There's a one for one promo on their chicken galbi now. We usually add on the fried rice and extra rice cakes. Water is charged at $1/table regardless of no. of pax. Love the kimchi here!

Loved the sotong in the rice and kimchi together. We ordered for 2 person share.
Portion is ok. Free flow of salad and drinks and kimchi too. Really nice! I like it!

I came here by myself - which seems like a bit of a waste of such good communal food. But was not disappointed. Great food and friendly staff. Will come again (with friends this time).

I thought their specialty was fried chicken but they recommended what I posted in picture for 1 person. Very very disappointed. Limited salad selection for me who do not eat Kim chi and 1st time I have to pay for ice water in a Korean restaurant that sells spicy things. Felt like blackmail. For a simple dish to pay SGD21+ is over rated. No more next time

We were invited by family to this Korean restaurant in Bugis Junction. Their teenage kids raved about it, and it does seem to be popular with young people, more a social event than anything else.We were provided what was effectively a large stir fry that we could ‘play’ with ourselves, limited only by our own creativity. The cheese hardened around the edges of the pan and was nearly impossible to eat. The meal was nothing special, and I’d rather eat elsewhere

We had the cheesy duet galbi which was interesting though not worth a repeat. More of a experience rather than flavour. Don't get me wrong, flavour was pretty ok. Giving it 3 stars mainly for the free flow of pretty good kimchi. Weird thing is we had to pay $1 for free flow of water per table...service was ok but lacking in enthusiasm. Had to repeat order thrice. Not something we'd expect for what we're paying. Like I mentioned, it's worth A visit.

Been to the place twice. This recent visit with daughter for dinner was satisfying. She enjoyed the chicken bulgogi cheese fried rice while I liked the spicy chicken stew. The server cooking the fried rice in front of us added to the dining experience. The downside is that two portions of the mains must be ordered for the first item which means that we have to pack away the excess fried rice. Will probably not return again, unless we have big appetite or are eating with more people

Dak galbi with tons of cheese is one of my favorite food. The cheese complements the spice of the chicken. Plus you get all these chewy tokopoki (rice cakes) in it. Dont forget to order the fried rice side dish. Just when you thought your meal is over the yummy fried rice rises like a Phoenix from the ashes of your dak galbi!!! *Look at my third photo for the fried rice.**spice level can be adjusted to mild or least spicey of you have a weak stomach for the chilli spice.***dont forget to drink yakult or buttermilk after otherwise your stomach will have a burnnnnn

expect long queues and wait at this outlet during peak hours and weekends and Singapore's public holiday. The shortest period I queued for was about 20~25 minutes. Big prawns are my favourite and the chicken of course. I prefer the rice than the noodles. Both are nice but personal preference. Spiciness can be highlighted to the waiters. Free flow of ice water and kimchi & salads at the bar for consumption

Went for dinner and ordered Cheese Chicken Galbi and Pancake. The cheese is found on the circumference of the large pan and the chicken, rice cakes and some vege in the center of the pan. The staff cooks the food right in front of you and the smell of cheese was fantastic as it heats up. The rice was added and cooked half way through our meal. As additional kimchi sauprce was added, the food was so spicy that I was perspiring profusely. Lesson learnt, don't add more kimichi sauce to the already spicy chicken. The pancake was nice too with the sauce provided

I ate at Westgate branch and always enjoy my meals there. It is usually pack so you have to be early. They have different set meals so you have to try all to find out which one you like.

Average food but staff were very nice!We ordered a non-spicy set with cheese (suitable for 3 pax) and another set with spicy chicken. We enjoyed the cheese a lot but the cheese turned a bit hard when the pot cools, so wasn't as nice as when it was still hot/warm. Would be better if there was a way to keep the pot warm while we ate.

Went for dinner with my family. Ordered a cheese set and a normal set. More than enough for a family of 4, not because of the amount of food but the lousy taste of the food. Spent about $80++, which is average of $20++ per pax. Not worth at all. Firstly, the chicken are not fresh for both sets and they use those frozen type. Secondly, in order to prevent us from tasting the "unfreshness" of the chicken, lots of chili paste were used to marinate the chicken. So both sets were rather spicy, not at all like those we ate in Seoul. The only thing that taste alike like those in Seoul is their sticky noodles. Thirdly, the cheese set came in large platter and the normal set came in a small hot plate. Looks and taste rather substandard for the price we paid. Lastly, their staffs were not helpful and very half hearted in serving us. They did not stir and cook the chicken well, simply walked over to use the spatula to touch the chicken on and off, extremely eager to off the fire. In less than 10 minutes, they off the fire and the chicken are not even cooked. Very ridiculous. In the end, we got to cook the chicken on our own. Wonder why we should pay for the 10% service charge when they did nothing to serve us or to cook the dish nicely. Side dishes were all self service anyway. I would not recommend this place to anyone and in fact, I would discourage people from going. Very lousy food with zero quality. Any coffeeshop can cook chicken on the hot plate nicer than Yoogane. Luckily we do not have to queue for this lousy dinner. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the queue

Went there for dinner and tried their cheese and meat set. It was really quitepricey at about 50 plus. It would be ideal for 3 people. Me and my friend couldn't finish it by ourselves due to the massive portion. The cheese hardens when the stove is off and it is pretty hard to chew for anybody with braces
3
I didn't experience any queue because we came to eat here quite early at or before 6pm. We ordered a lot, the big galbi to share, extra order dokboki, and a rice dish. I actually found the taste just average. After mixing the food, somehow the ingredients seems to get lost in the flavor. At least the cheese that came with our big galbi order was nice and provided a different effect on the taste buds. The cheese was supposed to offset the spice in the dish but I didn't find the spice that spicy as expected of a korean dish

Another place to satisfy my Korean craving! Tried Yoogane in Seoul and personally I think Yoogane Singapore has the same standard. Though it's rather pricey and the portion is too big for two persons...who cares! The location of the restaurant may be difficult to find for tourists though cos even for myself as a Singaporean has difficulty finding.
3
Its a nice new concept and unique, however i feel its not value for the money. The big pan consist of chicken, veg & cheese and plus adding a side order dokboki, drinks came out to $35 per head. It was a good try however it will not motivate me to return again due to the price.
3
I feel that Yoogane is too overrated. It's very pricey as compared to the outlets in South Korea itself. The taste wise, wasn't as highly raved as what people were talking about. I dine on Korean cuisines very frequently with my Korean colleagues, and we feel that the authenticity of Korean food taste wasn't there
4
this is one of the best dakgalbi in singapore, and it's really worth the queue. it's a little pricey, but the taste is worth it :) there are people to help cook your food for you, so basically u just need to sit back and watch them prepare everything for u. i'll definitely drop by again

Overall the experience is good. But consider going in 4s or more. The food that we wanted to try is too much as we ordered for a mixed one for 3-4 pax plus noodles. It is just too big portion. Kimchi is nice.. Not too spicy or sour. Recommended place for gathering
3
Came in because missed eating it in korea. Overall food is okay, not spectacular. just that not really worth it for the ambience. It's the been there once and not likely to return kind.
3
A one hit wonder in my books. Pretty expensive for just chicken and vege for 2 pax SGD55. Didn't get rice coz it is with cheese and looks totally sinful. Ordered with instant noodles instead which I prefer.

Tried the Yoogane branch at Westgate. This outlet is usually full for dinner and there is a queue to get in. Ordered the signature Chicken Galbi with Chukkumi Octopus. Basically both chicken and octopus are cooked right in front of you. You can take salad from a salad bar. The kimchi is average. Both the chicken and octopus are marinated with a red sauce, however they are not spicy. The chicken is good, however I find the octopus quite rubbery and difficult to digest. However this might be due to over cooking too. The cooking is handled by the staff and they rotate among themselves to serve you. I must say the service is prompt. However I would not be keen to return too soon and to even queue for this. Maybe it is just me! :-

IMO, this is one of the best Chicken Galbi in SG. Try the one with cheese for new experience. Don't worry if it is your first time because the staffs are very much willing to assist in cooking your galbi. They offer unlimitted side dishes like kimchi, pickles and salad. I hope soon they will also offer unli leafy vegetables and should have spicy soya bean paste. Overall, it was very good and we will come back again for sure

We visited the original store in Myeongdong Seoul several times and its the place for top shelf dakgalbi. This Singapore outlet is close to it but not perfect. The portion and taste were close but the pricetag will leave you wondering why. You need to come in early to avoid the long queue and go for their signature spicy chicken dakgalbi

Yoogane lives up to their real korean culture value for food. Food comes in big portion and scrumptiously good! Their new menu, melted cheese chicken galbi is for all cheese lovers. The excitement when you see a circle of shredded cheese melting their way as the food is cooked in the center. Wow! my heart melts along with it.Dip chicken with cheese, ramen with cheese, dukkbokki with cheese? Totally creative! A good hang out place with friends & families to catch some kpop vibes and share the circular love of korean delicacies

Your though going to Yoogane at 20.00 is totally wrong, you can't avoid crowd even at that late, the line might takes up to half an hour or more depend on how many party. The place has limited seat, four people might been the easiest number to get a seat. When in the line, waitress will give you menu and take your order, once you are invited to seat, take side dishes (kimchi and salad) as much as you want in the portion that you can finished, do not waste food. If you dont wanna order drink, same as almost all korean restaurant, there is free mineral water. The famous menu is chicken and seafood kalbi, one of our friend could not take seafood, so we asked for only chicken kalbi, the portion is for three person but if considering you order not just kalbi, it will be too full to finished the kalbi. You sure wanna finished the kalbi that cost S$59,9

Had a meal recently with the family, 3 members of which had tasted the original in Korea. The 3 jointly agreed that the original taste in Korea is a lot more better and spicier. I reckon, the Singapore branch had tweaked the taste to suit local tastebuds.Staffs were friendly and provide good service. Ambience was just as good, only that the lack of exhaust pipes resulted in all of us leaving the restaurant smelling like fried rice.In any case, the outing was pleasant and the pricing was reasonsble

I always walked by this restaurant with super long queue, and heard it's a famous restaurant in Korea opening their first chain in Singapore. Therefore, we popped by in the early evening when the queue is quite short.The various pots are quite expensive for Korean cuisine, we tried the seafood pot for two person with 2 rices and a soft drinks. The bill came around close to $80, which is not worth it. The seafood pot that we ate is quite spicy, so if you can't take spicy, maybe there are other non-spicy pots to choose from.They provided aprons to prevent stains on your clothes and will help you cook the foods when it arrived. May not consider to return for a second try
