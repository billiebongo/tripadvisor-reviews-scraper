This is a boutique ramen outlet in certain quarters. I hadn't been in several years and will not rush back. All salt and oil. Chausiu was generous but overwhelmed by salt and oil. And I do like my food salty!

An unpretentious, authentic and inexpensive ramen bar in glitzy Orchard Rd. Modest menu, excellent quality. Worth every moment.

Has walked past Uma Uma so many times over the last 2 years during lunch but only stepped in last Wednesday after my colleague introduced it. I’m typically quite particular about ramen and always go for tonkatsu. But the Uma Ramen was good. The soup base was rich and not too salty. The lunch combo was ~$15.90++ (depending on the ramen ordered) and comes with ramen, side dish and a drink.

We opted to get off-property and have lunch on Orchard Road. Ramen just sounded good to us both so we stopped in at Uma Uma. The lunch set included any choice of the ramen, an added topping, appetizer and drink (we did the beer for an additional up-charge). All in for the two lunch sets (with beer) was around $54 SGD.The food was delicious. Both the Garlic and Uma Uma ramen dishes fit our fancy. The meatball appetizers were okay, but the chick was fantastic - served with mayo and chili flakes. Honestly, despite being a bit pricey (though expected for Singapore/Orchard Road), I would return - Uma Uma

The spicy ramen (pictured) is one my favourites.I like noodles so I’ll always order an extra portion whenever I have this.The broth is tasty and you definitely won’t get that weird dry mouth feel after the meal - good sign that it’s not loaded with MSG

We noticed Uma Uma Ramen on our very first night in Singapore: Forum, the mall in which this izakaya is located, was pretty much across the road from our hotel, and since both my husband and I love ramen, we decided we’d come by here for at least one meal. So, on our last evening in the city, we came here for dinner with our four-year old. Uma Uma Ramen prides itself on 100% umami, 0% MSG food. They specialize in ramen of different kinds but they also offer other side dishes and smaller plates, including edamame, gyoza, dons, potato salad, soft beverages, alcohol, juices, and desserts like matcha ice cream. We ordered a garlic ramen and a chasiu don. Although Uma Uma have a good bit of seating indoors, they also have a handful of tables and chairs outside, which are good if you want a view looking out onto the road and terrace, or if—like us—you have a noisy toddler you’d rather not inflict on fellow diners. Ours was given her own high chair plus a kiddie bowl and plastic cutlery, so was very happy. The garlic ramen and chasiu don arrived within less than five minutes. The chasiu don, sliced roasted pork belly with a lovely sweet-salty glaze, on a bed of sticky rice and garnished with chopped spring onions, was delicious. So, too, was the ramen: a fabulously flavourful broth, lots of ramen, very good roast pork, plump crisp beansprouts (lots of them, too), fried garlic, and a lovely soft boiled egg with a salted yolk. This was a good big bowl, and filled us up pretty well. We still did want something more, so settled for a portion of gyoza. Unlike the ramen and the chasiu don, the gyoza took a long time to arrive—we waited about 15 minutes for it, perhaps a bit more. But it was worth it: tiny pillows of beautifully seasoned minced pork, chewy and tender, steamed and fried, served with a dipping sauce that was salty-sour-sweet, and with a sprinkle of spicy red powder (ponzu pepper? I don’t know). Very good.We spent S$36.50 for our meal, inclusive of all taxes and service charge. Excellent value for money. If you’re anywhere in the vicinity and you like Japanese food, Uma Uma is well worth a try

This review is getting a good rating.Maybe I didn’t order their signature ramen, it wasn’t like super nice for me. I ordered the autumn set at $20 (see photo). The highlight for me were the tamago and matcha ice cream definitely not the ramen. On my way out, I saw the waiter serving some rice bowls which looked yummy. Perhaps I will explore those next time

Quite good tasting spicy Ramen, portion is generous with enough noodles & broth.
Service on the other hand is not super friendly but robotic - but I guess for a Ramen place ok.
5
Me and my parents went to Uma Uma and it was wonderful. It has really good food and service. If there is ever a line outside its quite small and doesn't take long. I suggest Uma Uma.
5
Am back after a memorable lunch a few weeks back! Food are really great and the broth was excellent! Fast service Abd staff are friendly with great efficiency.
5
The restaurant has an industrial look with some elements of wood. We tried only ramen and it was delicious! The broth was creamy, dense and quite salty. The black mushrooms gave that needed crunch, the eggs were soft and moist, the pork was nicely cooked and noodles were al dente. Quire a great place for a quick lunch.
4
This is my favourite ramen place! Good balance in the flavours of the broth, without it being too heavy or salty, which tends to be the case in many ramen bars. This is the only place where I can actually drink through half the bowl of soup. Go for the classic Uma.Small place but you will generally find a seat, and it is pretty child-friendly
5
LOVED THIS PLACE, went back three times in three days!!!I ate the Bushi Tonkotsu Ramen $16, with an $8 'upgrade' I got an additional topping, a choice if sides (I chose gyoza) & an Asahi beer.Hubby ate the Spicy Caisu Ramen $16 & with a $4 upgrade got an additional topping, a chicken karaage side & a choice of non-alcoholic beverages. upgrading is a weekday only lunch special option.Kids Menu available or the $6 sides can also be upsized for just a couple of dollars extra.

The ramen was good but not outstanding. Cha siu was of good quality, good fatty portion and braised with good flavour. I loved the sweet and salty combination with a hint of burnt smokey fragrance so characteristic of BBQed meat. The Don(rice) was drizzled with terikayi sauce which added a honey like sweetness to balance the meat. Top it up with a runny onsen egg to bind the rice and meat together. The rice is relatively small in portion compared to other shops. This is good because it's only 5dollars and leaves room in your wallet and tummy for gyoza (small fried dumplings) and a beer.

Tried the dry ramen from Umauma. But first, they have a notification outside their shop mentioning that you can not go in & be seated unless all the entire party is present.Ok..just continue with the food. I tried the Mazesoba. It consists of spring onion, bamboo shoots, chili oil,leeks,sesame seeds and pork belly.The ramen is al dente. It reminds me of the indonesian noodle, bakmi keriting.It is quite tasty, not too spicy and no msg added.For the Tan Tan Men, it consists of sesame base, minced pork, sesame oil, white onion.The taste is really peanuty (from sesame) , and reminds me of gado-gado. Very interesting taste.I don't really like their pork meatballs, as it has a strong porky smell, but on the other hand, their gyoza is quite nice.Will i be back to Umauma? Yes.

Not the best (go to Japan Town for that) but fairly decent Ramen at the top of Orchard. Staff are very friendly. Prices are about $15-16 depending on the dish.Note- they will let you sneak in MacDonalds for your kid while you eat ramen and have a cold beer
5
my daughter and I were staying in singapore and didnt want to go to far from hotel to eat. We discovered this restaurant and enjoyed the food so much and the casual atmosphere we returned most evenings. I had the Tan Tan noodles absolutely delicious. The prices are very reasonable and the food is to die for and the staff are very efficient would highly recomend
4
Great venue for ramen! Quality of food is excellent! Service are friendly. Staff are efficient and food wait is neither too Long. A venue ideal for family.
4
I had the edamame and Uma Uma ramen. It was pretty good! Service is fast and friendly.
Don't order the lemon iced tea, it's from a can and overly sweet.
4
I am a regular there. This is one of the most tasty ramen in town with NO MSG! I like this place and all the ramen. My favourite is the Tam Tam ramen :)
5
I thought not to stop there, but return on the next day again.
The ma Ramen is so delicious.
The place is small, but service is good.
4
Have visited uma2 several times. Service is quick and the ramen is delicious. I recommend the tonkotsu ramen and bushi ramen. Pricing is reasonably. Around $15 per bowl.
5
The Ramen was very delicious and is a valuable lunch opportunity. The portion of the Ramen is big, further the lunch set includes Gyoza and a free adding (bean-sprouts, leak etc) for the Ramen. I will come back again!
4
I had the Uma Uma Ramen - very tasty bowl - for about $13. For another $2, they added a small size dish. I had the friend chicken morsels. Good service. Good Ramen. I will return for sure.
4
This small ramen house is located in The Forum Mall right on Orchard Road. It Fukuoka-style ramen is second to none. At reasonable prices too!
4
I always feel the soup base really makes the difference between a good ramen and a great one. I prefer it to be not too milky or thick and Uma Uma makes this the way I like it! the bite-sized gyoza (not in picture) is great too
3
Place has a nice vibe on it. I ordered their Uma Uma ramen. Broth was rich, but flavor was not that rich. Pork toppings were good (Chasui) I'm not sure if my taste buds were just off today. Chicken karaage was good though. Serving is enough
4
Came here after a long flight. Delicious, filling soups. Broth was very flavorful and meat super tender. Decent value, around 15SGD per dish.
4
Patronized this place several times and they've never disappointed. The food is good and service is efficient. However, I find their servings a little small even after an upsize.
3
Far too salty for our liking. It was rather disappointing, quite a pity as the noodles were of high quality.
4
If you like Hakata style ramen this is the place for you. I have eaten the spicy ramen with minced meat at Uma Uma a couple of time and the quality and consistency always surprise me. The restaurant is not very expensive and you can get a ramen and gyoza fro around $20
3
Was looking to try a different Ramen restaurant near my hotel.Already tried another restaurant the other day so decided to try Uma Uma.Location is convenient, but has very limited seating capacity.Food was good, but was rather bland compared to other ramen's I have had.Ordered the Uma Uma which was supposed to be spicy, any spice or heat did not register for me.Also portions (mostly noodles) could have been better, the chasu pork was tender and buttery.Not very impressed and found the food to be rather spending in comparison to what you receive (S$20 for ramen & can of iced tea).Other than the hostess, the rest of the wait staff were not very friendly
5
I was reluctant to visit Uma Uma as I am not a fan of Japanese food (like it, but prefer Korean), however I was persuaded by my fiancee, seeing it was lunch and very close to our hotel at the top end of Orchard Road.I am extremely happy to report that I was very wrong.This small Japanese themed noodle bar provides very good quality, value for money food; linked to efficient and friendly service.The flavours are good, the menu meets most people's needs and I would recommend anyone to try eating at Uma Uma
4
The ramen dishes are delicious! Some are on the spicy side which is ideal if you enjoy spicy foods, but they also have dishes which are less spicy. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. I'd recommend coming here for lunch or maybe an early dinner
5
I had the spicy chasiu ramen . SMASHED IT . Beautiful . Enjoy your ramen . I have to write a minimum of 100 words . Nearly there . BOOM . If you live ramen go eat here if you don't ! Then a McDs is down the road . Trust

Located on main Orchard Road ground floor, It was one of the few places open at 10 PM. At a supper we ordered the Ramen. The food was very good. great flavors. Good sized helping which was adequate for two people.The soup was thick, with more than adequate meat, and the egg. The service was fast and efficient. Not very costly. Definitely would like to go back there
4
In Singapore, there are more than 900 Japanese restaurants. You will not have a problem trying to find them, however, Uma Uma is located at Forum which is close to Nasim and Orange Grove Road which is near Japanese Embassy. Thier Ramen has a solid chewing and tasty with soup being cooked long hours. People are friendly and you can erlax after the shopping trip along the Orchard Street
5
Spicy ramen superb. Soup was very good as well as noodle. Overall is clean, and nice decoration. Smell good.
4
Great ramen with tender meat slices and thick flavoursome soup. Service was attentive and fast. We finished our Sunday lunch in a comfortable one hour. The chicken karaage was tasty with mayo and chilli powder. One bite gyoza was good but all stuck together so some effort to separate it out. Will definitely go again!
1
This place serves horrible tasting ramen. I ordered the spicy ramen, but the soup was so sweet. There was still a sweet aftertaste after I left the restaurant. Spicy ramen should be hot and spicy! The chef needs to look up this word in the dictionary because he obviously doesn't know what it means.The gyozas were also so small and tasted ok, but nothing special. I will definitely not go back and definitely DO NOT recommend this place. This is a big waste of money. I was extremely disappointed and now know why when I went at dinner time, the restaurant was empty (except for one other table)
4
We found this place next to our hotel and we felt like having noodle soup for dinner. We were thrilled with the service and the quality of the food. Full of nice flavours and appropriately balanced taste. There were not many people which I liked and probably gave us better attention
4
Very happy with the overall ramen experience here. Initially we were planning to visit Daruma Ramen at Tripleone Somerset, but after going there and discovering it had permanently closed we decided to give this place a try (despite the somewhat mediocre reviews). Opted for the Uma Uma Ramen and the Bushi Ramen, plus a side serving of gyoza. All three dishes were very good, although I think the noodles in the Uma Uma were better. I particularly enjoyed the bamboo shoots in the Bushi Ramen. My 4 year old daughter seemed pretty happy with the overall quality, which is always a good sign as she can be rather a ramen snob at times
3
This was my first try on ramen in Singapore. First time heard about it from a friend a couple of years ago and I finally had the chance to visit the place. Ramen was OK. Good n' tasty chicken karaage, though. Place was small but comfortable. Tips: get the set menu where you can have the ramen, personal portion of chicken karaage, extra bamboos, and some ocha
2
We finally decided to give Uma Uma a try after walking past it for months. The large poster that boasts of its origins in Japan gave us hope that this would be a satisfying meal.We ordered a bowl of ramen each. The taste was so-so. Texture of noodles was alright. The egg was probably the only thing that was right. Overall a nothing to shout about bowl of ramen. Will we be back again? You bet...not
3
We came here when the restaurant first opened nearly a year ago, and the broth of the Uma Uma ramen was so fatty that my partner has not wanted to eat ramen since! This time, I tried the spicy chasiu ramen; the broth was good, not that fatty, and the noodles were good, but overall it was really nothing special. Outside Japan, in order to survive, a ramen shop must have outstanding ramen (like Totto ramen in NY, where the Q can be 2-hours long); offer buzz (like Ippudo Tao on Mohamed Sultan or Bone Daddies in Soho, London); or have an extensive menu (like Shoryu also in London). Uma Uma does not have any of these, and it is too 'high-profile' for being just a neighbourhood eatery. Maybe its owners are content it being uma (which means tranquil in sanskrit)
4
I had the dry Ramen and it was great, The noodles were al dente, the sauce and egg mixed together gave a wonderful flavor to the noodles. The portion was a little small for me and I should have ordered extra noodles. But as I still had space in my tummy, I ordered and bowl of the dry noodles. Had a small bowl of soup just to taste it as the sign board said that they did not add any MSG. The soup/broth was nice but I still prefer the dry Ramen
4
We enjoyed our meal there - ordered 4 ramen, 2 gyoza, 2 ice green tea and 2 beer. It was $110 for the four of us which is very expensive for ramen! The broth was very tasty and the noodles vey good. The one slice of pork we found in the ramen was mainly fat. We are not sure we would go back. I would rather go to Nadamen at the ShangriLa which has amazing set lunch specials for close to the same price
