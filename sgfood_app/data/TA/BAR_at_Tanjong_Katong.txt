This bar is on the corner of Tanjong Katong Road and Wilkinson Road. I live in the neighbourhood and have become a frequent frequenter!Previously called Bar Bar Black Sheep, it is covered and open air seating. There is a really excellent North Indian restaurant on site which is great value for money and good selection of all the Indian favourites. There is also a European restaurant on site as well but since the Indian is so good I have never tried it.Beer is also value for money, happy hour is 2 pints of Carlsberg for $18. GST and service is included in the ticket price here so that really does turn out to be very good value.It is a casual setting, neighbourhood bar type of feel. Family friendly. Good place to go for an Indian dinner or a fe drinks with family or friends. Recommend stopping by if you are in Tanjong Katong and thirsty
