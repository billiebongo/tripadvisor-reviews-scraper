Had great reviews from friends about this place and thought I check it out for myself.Was greeted at the entrance by Vicron( the boss!). The place feels very warm and cozy. It is really a nice place to have a leisurely lunch. Their prices are very reasonable, and you are spoilt wiht choices with the kind of food you want!I had the Wagyu Beef Burger, and upgraded my fries to Truffle fries. It was unbelievable good! I have had Wagyu Burgers in a number of places, but none of them comes close to this.My friend ordered the Laksa Prawn Paste (spaghetti in their unique Laksa sauce). As my friend is allegic to seafood, they were very accommodating and replaced the prawns with chicken instead. It was heavenly! Their chef had managed to maintain the fragrance and full body of the Laksa sauce, without the heaviness and oiliness.For dessert, we shared the Churros Waffle with Vanilla ice cream. The "hybrid" waffle was fresh and crisp, and it complimented very well with both the chocolate sauce and maple syrup.If you like a cozy place to catch up with friends, where the staff are friendly, and the food good and interesting, then Toothsome is the perfect place to be
