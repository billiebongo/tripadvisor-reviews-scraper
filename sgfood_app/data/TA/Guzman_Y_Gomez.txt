First timer visiting this new QSR in their newly opened outlet @Northpoint. Usually packed in the evening and during lunch also reasonable numbers of guests. Order system is easy to understand via step by step modules. Everything is prepared fresh and tasty. Prices are within market range, nice addition of new food places.

My first time tried this mexican restaurant after newly opened in northpoint city. We enjoyed the food, value for money, service is good but just that the staff didnt provide advice, despite I ordered regular size for the corn chips and comes with big bowl of sauce. In fact regular will do as chips is just one size. Total damage for 2pax is $28. No service charge, only gst charg
