Great coffee. Cakes and tarts also very good but expensive. Lunch not quite up to par but still worth stopping by for coffee if in the area.

Chilled ambience, friendly staff and delicious food. After a week of outside food, I was craving for something that felt like and tasted home made. The Bakehouse gave me that. Simple well prepared food. Loved the fruit smoothie!

Noticed this little bake shop next to my hotel. Went in early to start the day and was very impressed with amazing fresh products, fantastic espresso and friendly staff.

We dined here for breakfast & coffee on a Monday morning. It's a small cafe but with seating area outside to enjoy the nice morning sun.We ordered their breakfast platter which lets us choose how we wanted our eggs cooked and a choice of main and side dishes. So we ordered it with poached eggs, sausage, potato hash and toast. It tasted amazing and really woke up our senses! It was quite good in value for its price.The coffee was great! As my girlfriend loves coffee art, she kindly asked the waitress to make our coffee with coffee art, although they don't normally do it, the waitress kindly said that she would try her best. The result wasn't too bad, and my girlfriend enjoyed herself with a nice new photo for her Instagram :)Overall, we had a lovely breakfast meal here! Big ups for its quiet area, kind staff and tasty food

It is well decorated with an English flavour. It is tucked at one corner of the hotel. Opposite this food outlet is Anchorage Point and on its right, is IKEA. The food quality is very much home cooked standard, and the presentation of the food could be improved with nice white big plate that will enhance the value of the meal served.The food served, seafood pasta and fish & chips are reasonably fine. No GST is implemented at the outlet as it is very much still in its infant stage of growth. Its little shortcoming is well forgotten with the good customer service rendered by the staff. Will go again for the ambience and maybe a cup of coffee only. Take a look at the photo posted

We stopped by for lunch. There is quite a bit in this area (mainly Asian cuisine) but we just wanted a coffee and sandwich and this was perfect. Had a set lunch for $14 including a soup/salad which was nice. Ingredients were good so worth it. Lunch capped off with a nice coffee. Apparently there are two other "Bakehouse" in SIngapore but I have never come across them. Possibly easy to confuse with Baker and Cook which has a similar offering. The deserts looked great but we were just too full after lunch !PS Added bonus, there is parking redemption if you spend more than $10 in the mini mall (inc eateries

Stopped here for a coffee recently. There was some confusion with the order: instead of getting a cappuccino I somehow ended up with a flat white, but the coffee was still quite decent. Not much else in the vicinity so this makes for a good choice

Fancied passing by this coffee shop after a short visit to Ikea. I was simply smitten with the quaint ambiance and the courteous welcome of the service staff. Their carrot cake is melt in your mouth type and is just heavenly! Long black proved to be a good pair. Heard from reviews that brunch here is good. Would definitely come by to try soon

We ate her last year and remembered it, it's actually impossible to forget because the food is so delicious.Situated bang next to IKEA it offers a fabulous and far more peaceful alternative to the IKEA restaurant!The food is amazing, we enjoyed the salmon croissants and very good Cappuccinos whilst my grand daughter loved her Pain au Chocolate and natural orange juice.All in all an excellent breakfast, nice people also

Stumbled upon this restaurant because IKEA was too crowded. It was a pleasant discovery nonetheless.Maybe it is just me but who would have expect curry with risotto would be heavenly? The prawns were big and succulent, and the ambiance is good for small group gatherings as well. The only fallback is that you need to order and pay at the counter before dining. Lucky for us, we chose the seats nearest to the counter.The seats weren't comfy and the prices for the food was on the higher end ($23 for the curry prawn risotto). But the food was definitely worth that price
