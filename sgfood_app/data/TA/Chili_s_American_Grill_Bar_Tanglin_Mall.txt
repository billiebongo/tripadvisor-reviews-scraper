Was there for a birthday celebration with a big family group of over 20 people.service was very good and the food / drinks were just perfect.Will be there again for future meals.
Would rate it 8.5 out of 10 on overall experience....
4
A nice setting, great service and the standard chilli food. It was quick, cheap and cheerful - which unless you eat very locally in Singapore you don't find it too often.
5
It was a cheerful place with very reasonable prices for pizza and soft drinks etc. It was quite busy which is usually a good sign. Friendly efficient staff on the job

Living overseas it's always a treat to be able to eat at a good western restaurant like Chilis. Always had good food and service was great. Identical food to what you would find in America.
1
Our food was brought to us completely separate. I had my steak within 5 minutes and sat waiting for my husband's pasta for 15 minutes. By the time I started mine it was cold, as I had been politely waiting, until my husband insist I start. Then his arrived and I was finished and had to watch him eat alone. The waiter gave excuses that it was the kitchen's fault with not even a suggestion of restitution. We paid our inflated bill asap and left. Typical American fast food fare. Not good at all.
4
I would give it a 5 on Food. And 4 for service. My husband and I came for lunch. Wanted guacamole chips n Salsa. This was good. We wanted 2 orders of chicken tacos and server only came with one? Asked for Chilli's wet wipes and they didn't have them at this restaurant
3
If you are after a quick, no-fuss, American-style meals, this is the place to go. We visited Chili's for my son's birthday treat and it made his day. The food portions were generous, albeit a little processed, where our enchilada was baked into the plate with crusty cheese! The ribs are worth ordering, with a generous coating of barbecue sauce accompanied by a basket of fries. If you have a sumptuous appetite, I suggest a full rack as a half rack just leaves you wanting more! The ultimate bacon burger was well cooked, stuffed with tomato, lettuce, fried onion, pickles and a 'magic' sauce, also accompanied by a basket of fries. All this washed down by 'bottomless' drinks served with loads of ice in a large plastic mug!The atmosphere was good, with large TV screens to induce those reflex-action dining skills. The servers were enthusiastic, delivering large plates of food onto small tables within our booth. A good experience and it seems quite popular with families, where they pile in, eat, and then leave to continue their shopping! Eat, shoots and leaves!If there was one advise to potential diners - bring your own wet wipes as "Chili's do not provide wet wipes" - you will find it quite useful after having ribs as the sauce is extremely sticky even after a good lick! There were no wash basin within the restaurant, and we regularly saw parents escorting their food covered children to the public restrooms on the other side of the mall

Went with the family for Sunday lunch. Service was good and attentive. Food itself was mediocre. I wasnâ€™t expecting Michelin star quality, but the food was very average. Had the combo platter to start. Fried cheese was decent, but southern rolls were a let down. Fajita was slightly over cooked. Chicken bowl was decent, though slightly under seasoned. Suspect drinks would be good especially during happy hour so may be back to try that with nibbles.
2
We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday,Came here in the afternoon and We helped ourselves to find a table as there was no hostess at the entrance where they stated there "please wait to be seated but it was already 15 minutes so just went in, there was only 2 guy staff running the restaurant and only after almost an hour another 2 came by.We felt that the staff are so busy and running everywhere. We can't blame them as it might be due to lack of staff and the restaurant started to get busy.The food was not nice, found the chicken too salty. We love going to Chili's but maybe ill think twice again with this recent experience..
2
We are a big Fan of Chillies as we have tried in so many places starting from America to Asia. But least we knew that Chillies in tanglin singapore is so pathetic! We had a confirmed reservation for 3 at 7.00pm. Though we arrived on time still we had to wait as the waiting staff at the door said tables not ready. From the kids meal we ordered macaroni n cheese pasta with corn on a cob for our girl. After fininshing the pasta when our daughter lifted up the corn we noticed behind the corn was eaten (clearly they have given used or left over to us). After we showed they apologised and changed it immediatedy and later waived the kids meal but point is how can these fancy places serve dirty leftover food to others.Horrible!!!we ordered chips n guacamole which they came up saying,'sorry we ran out of chips'.we said fine ,just get only the guacamole, which never arrived.Overall it was an horrible experience and i would highly recommend anybody not to go to this restuarant.Extremely poor service
5
love the food and service will come back again love the baby back rib it's superb eating is the best deal I will tell to my friends and colleagues to visit this restaurants cocktail is also nice
3
Sure, it is Chili's but the food is fine and the margaritas are tops. One of the reasons why I visit this place every time I am in Singapore.
4
Tex Mex with good range of cocktails, we had burgers which were very good. Staff attentive and friendly.
3
Had a light bite with the family there as I was craving some good old American food. Chili's has a light bite's section which was good as we weren't looking for anything too heavy. The food was safe, meaning it wasn't exceptional but it wasn't bad - what you'd expect from a Chili's.But one thing that struck us is how expensive Chili's is for what you get. I certainly didn't feel value from what you get.Also, our daughter wanted a scoop of ice creme - it came quite melted (like it was sitting around for a while before serving, or the bowl it came in just came from the dish washer and was warm). We sent it back, and the waiter was nice and tried getting us a better scoop, but the replacement wasn't much better.Details like this are important. We'd probably opt for another restaurant when we crave the American experience later, like Brewerkz. (better value IMO)
3
A fairly decent restaurant - was quite busy and got busier as we left! Situated at the Tanglin Mall it is fairly centrally located and easy to get to.The menu is your typical mix of Tex-mex food - burgers, steaks, tacos, salads, ribs - and a good choice. Kids menu could do with some smaller versions of the adult menu.Had ribs & smoked chicken wings to start - ribs were excellent, wings were an "acquired taste" shall we say. My son had the kids cheese burger bites with a side of sweetcorn - a FULL cob of corn is waay too much to give a child, half portion would have been sufficient! His burger bites weren't mini burgers it was one large one cut in half! One side was ok (I think as he had eaten it) but the other was under-cooked (still red, never mind pink) but fortunately my son had eaten enough so didn;t want it. I pointed it out and the waitress offered an alternative but I declined. The manager then came over, apologised and again offered a replacement, then an alternative after being told no thanks he advised he'd take the cost off the bill. Not expected but well received so thank you again Chili's.My other son had tacos - with a request of just meat - and he said they were great (although he had expected hard shell not soft). Hubby's burger was "ok" and my salad was a bit of a let down. Free refill drinks was well received and we didn't even have to ask they just appeared!All in all for an evening saved from cooking it was fine, would I go again - possibly but just for the ribs..
4
When the urge for Tex Mex fare hits me, I head for Chili's. This place has never disappointed me. The portions are American size, which means I am always stuffed. Quality is good and has been consistent. Staff are friendly and help with suggestions. Nice restaurant for young families as well. For good American food, for me Chili's is a good choice
3
Didn't know this restaurant, when friend said a chilli having offer lunch$10.90, I thought was peranakan food. No is western.It price from $10.90 with main, salad & drink.Simple western meal. We order 3 diffrrent sets from $10.90- 14.90 We had fish & chip, chicken wrap, soup ,ice lemon drink that tasted like sugar water
1
We turned about at 8:55 and were told the restaurant was closed despite the fact that we called and they said they closed at 10:00, their website says they close at 10:00, the sign outside the restaurant says they close at 9:30. Nevertheless, they were still quite busy and were taking orders from other customers but the manager said they were closing at 9:00 while blaming the "confusion" on his staff.
3
Food pretty good-- good flavour, portions, etc-- service friendly but slow-- also brought out things out of sequence which is never goo
2
Waited 30 mins to be seated and waited another 45 mins for the food to arrived. They should change to purely delivery service since the wait for customers are so long and the deliveroo comes non-stop
4
We were there for a birthday treat and we ordered a set lunch each which comes with drinks. Nice Ambience with attentive staff
3
Menu is extensive and food is good. Place was very very crowded from early on. We were in a bit of a hurry so it served its purpose.
4
With little time for lunch, only one hour, the set menu on offer was very quick and enjoyable. Even had iced tea without sugar available. The pulled pork bun/sandwich was very tasty but messy. The rest is just the same as child's everywhere else but without the crowd
5
I ate at Chili's with my family. The food was great and so was the service. Atmosphere is friendly and happy. Gives you a good feeling while dining there. My kids loved their mac & cheese with the corn on the cob ! The honey chipotle crispers are so yummy !!! Nachos are delicious !! Definitely would go again and tell friends about it !
5
I'm from the US but don't eat at Chili's when I'm home. With that said, I never miss a chance to eat at the Chili's in Tanglin Mall when in Singapore. For some reason it is so much better than any Chili's in the US or any other country that I have eaten at. Even if you don't like Chili's, This one is definitely worth a try
2
It took the waitress half an hour to simply take our order. The food took another half hour. I had ordered the vegetarian enchilada pasta and I got the one with chicken instead. The only reason I am giving Chili's a second star is because the food was actually good. Horribly disappointed
1
We went there on a Sunday for lunch. We ordered Mexican food. Nachos as a starter and fajitas for mains. Both the nachos as well as the fajitas had hair in them. The fact that two separate dishes have the same problem is worrying. The floor below the table was covered in dropped food and no odd bothered to clean up. After pointing out the hairs in our dishes we were able to cancel our orders
4
My wife and I have been going to this Chilis since it opened a few years back. Most of the time the food is really good but not always consistent. Highly recommend the Quesadilla Explosion Salad or the Nachos but we have to tell them to cook the chicken well done because sometimes it is not fully cooked. We bypass the vinaigrette for avocado ranch dressing. Chips and Salsa are always good. You can get fresh brewed iced tea as well. During this visit the service was okay but they were way understaffed and it took awhile in between being attended to. The one consistent complaint would be all items are overpriced
4
My family and I enjoyed dinner at Chili's one evening in July. The pork ribs were succulent, and the enchiladas quite good, but the highlight was the margaritas, the best I have had for a very long time. You will not be disappointed.
3
This is a good alternative for a traditional fast food restaurant. The service is very fast and the food is good, The pricing is though a bit over average. I had a nixed fajitas and can recommend it
4
Chilis is a good spot to sneak a nice lunch or Dinner. Food is typical Chilis Tex mex American fare and consistently good. Really like the new menu items and hope they bring back permanently the Beef Brisket Burrito because that was really good but didn't have it this last visit. Worth a visit if you are hungry and in the Tanglin Mall or immediate area
3
I visited this place for a late lunch on a weekday. Most of the lunch crowd had gone. Would have preferred a brighter place by the window looking out the street but tables were not cleared yet. The place seemed sleepy and service was also lethargic, a wind down from peak hour lunch. We ordered smoked wings, flat bread and milkshake. Food was served quickly, quality was acceptable but the overall experience was not as "American" as we expected it to be.
4
I was on my own for business and felt like some western food so I wanted to eat somewhere comfortable for a solo eater. I ordered a great steak burrito bowl salad. Lots of flavour and very fresh. Good service
2
Chillis have made big changes to their menu since I last ate here. It looks interesting but a big move away from its roots. The table was dirty when we were seated and we ended up wiping it ourselves. I wanted to order a starter portion of nachos but at $25 it's outrageous. The burger was barely ok but was overcooked and dry, how can you fail to cook a burger properly?If what you want is quantity over quality then look no further, but if you want better food for less go to Hard Rock just down the road
5
It was my birthday and my boyfriend took me here. I would say i love the ambience,though it was packed that time when we went for dinner. We had a very yummy chicken enchaladas which me and my boyfriend shared. I had mojito but for me it was not to my liking. I found it bland,not flavourful enough according to my tastebuds. We had a free dessert,a brownie with ice cream which is heaven!!.planning to come back soon.
4
Went mid afternoon so very quiet so seating was done quickly.Ordered the "Ancho Salmon" which is salmon with citrus chile sauce and rice with steamed broccoli. It was superb. Although the serving is quite small it has taste in every mouthful. The broccoli with the citrus chile sauce was a revelation and something I will try at home. If you are looking for a lighter, waistline saving meal, I highly recommend it. All virtuous feeling left with the milkshake of course. The most luxurious milkshake I have had in years and well worth the calories. Portion size aside, it was a perfect late, light lunch. Recommende
2
I don't think i will come for the new chicken burrito lunch package. It is so dry and hard...both the crevice and the rice. They put little bit of cheese at the corner of the burritos. That's it!
5
Consistent with US experience...and when you're on the road for a week or more, this is a good break for western food, and especially the Chilli's salads! The staff is friendly and more than happy to accommodate "take away" if you can't manage 1 more night of room service.
3
My friend wanted to eat at chili's so we went there. We ordered the pork fajita & pork burrito set lunch which came with drink, soup or salad. The portion size for the burrito was good. Came with crispy fries. Had the enchilada soup. It was nice. The burrito was big but the pork was rock hard.... What a downer...My friend's fajita was good but too few tortilla (only 3pcs) we both felt at least 4-5pcs is required. She was still hungry after the meal. Will we be back? Maybe. The lunch is quite value. But hope the taste quality is improved...
5
Ordered some appetizers along with a full rack of BBQ and Garlic roasted ribs. Food and service was simply excellent
4
I tried the Sante Fe Chicken salad and it was delicious. I found the portion a bit too big for one but if shared it's perfect. The service was fast and friendly.
4
Love the " Santa Fe " salad, fresh, crunchy and very tasty.
Mac and Cheese also good!
Service was fast and professional.
Wifi is available.
They don't accept AE card.
4
Had rapid dinner on Friday last week. Got a table right away. Friendly service. Food's good and no surprise, quality is there. Not gourmet but hearty.
4
Walked into Chilis for dinner and it was a satisfying experience. Adding to the experience was the ever-smiling and efficient lady who waited on us that day. Perfect!
5
Big portion, friendly staffs, less crowded (maybe because of the location) , delicious food & serve fast!
5
Since moving to Singapore, I've always visited this place with my families on the weekends or when we are free. The food is always top notch and the servers are always attentive. One waitress, I believe her name was Purani and one other waiter who was Philipino (Sorry I couldn't get his name) always deliver the top notch service every time we are back and that is what brings us back to Chili's everytime! We usually go and order the Classic Nachos, Triple Dippers, and the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Purani is always attentive and when our bottomless beverage are not even finished, she already brought over new glasses for us. The other waiter, when we went in today, he greeted me and say 'Welcome back!', that really made me feel like 'wow, he actually remembered me from my last visit'. It also happened that I was celebrating my dad's and I birthday today and it was a really special one, special thanks to Purani and the waiter (next time I will get his name and update you all :D) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
4
We recently visited Chili's outlet at Tanglin Mall for lunch. We ordered Fajitas and Salad. Food was served within time expected and service was also friendly and attentive, maybe also given that we are there after lunch crowd was almost done.However food quality was good and fresh, no surprises and Menu was also updated recently
3
Basic "American" style food. Reasonable quality and service.A fairly broad selection on the menu. We chose the full rack of ribs. They were meaty, and fairly good, but not cooked fresh. The other selection was "craft burger bites" - very disappointing. The quality of burger patty was OK, but the dish is a disaster. Very dry - none of the other described ingredients on it. just a patty and a poor quality bun. Absolutely horrible.The lack of serviettes - especially wet wipes for the ribs - was annoying. Even after asking several times, only a single small wet wipe arrived.Otherwise the service was good and the atmosphere is pleasant
1
We had regularly eaten at Chili's in the past and decided to stop for dinner on our way home las t week. We ordered some boneless chicken wings and a fajita. the chicken wings were nothing other than cheap nuggets and the fajitas were sloppy and cheap. A VERY disappointing meal that was expensive and of poor quality. Will not be returning
3
Having been in Singapore a while, I decided to update my last review. At the end of the day, they do Chilis pretty well. So, if you want a Chilis fix, the Tanglin restaurant is a good one. Staff have always been accommodating of our kids ... although we went on an off day and service was slow ... but that was an anomaly as we have been a few times and most times they are attentive
5
had a satisfying dining for two. loving the dishes. Nice ambience and great service. Stone throw way from Orchard road.
5
We eat here often. The food and service here is consistently good. I can't say the same for their other outlets in Singapore which is why we always come back to this one. There is one particular server here, a philippino, he is just fantastic. He is so friendly and helpful, even remembers what drinks we usually order.
5
We was at the Tanglin Mall looking for a place to have some dinner, finally we just decided to go to this place after looking at other restaurant menus in the mall. The staff welcomed us happily and seated us. I had no idea about Mexican food, the waitress recommended the MIX & MATCH Fajita Trio and my friend had craft burgers. The service was quick and the food was so delicious. The price was reasonable and the atmosphere was great to have a quiet dinner.The next day since this place was close to our hotel we went to have some Indian food in an other restaurant, but it was closed. So we decided to go back to this restaurant again a I had to go to the airport after a quick dinner. We was welcomed warmly and seated. The waitress who served us on the previous day came to the table with the menus and said " Welcome back to the restaurant Sir !, how was you day ", me and my friend looked each other and was shocked, how can she remember us. This moment was touched by my friend and me.It showed how great the service staff was. The my friend had gone by himself after 3 day before heading back to Australia, The staff had recognized him and after getting to know my friend was leaving, they staff had sung a farewell song to him. He was shocked.That was my experience. The food was great and awesome, but what made our experience memorable was the friendly staff. I highly recommend this place. Dress code is casual
4
Chili's at Tanglin mall is conveniently located in the heart of singapore. Quality is food is really good. Portion is even better. Kids love it as there are many choices burgers, nachos, fajitas, enchiladas, sandwiches etc. They play peppy music while everyone can watch basketball match on different TV screens. It's a happy atmosphere. Staff is efficient and service is fast. Overall a good experience with family and friends. And yes, plenty of cocktail options also available.
3
Other than the grilled chicken platter (mind you, no other types of meat available), the rest of the food tastes awful. The wrap was dry and the gravy was too strong, the coleslaw tastes blend, even KFC coleslaw tastes better and worse of all, the carbonated drinks are flat. We tried to change for another carbonated one, tastes the same, flat
4
From the moment we entered service was amazing, staff were friendly and efficient, and the food came out in a timely manner. You know what you are expecting dining American, big portions, rich food and chili's did not under deliver! It was great for a once off but the prices are too high to eat there everyday.
5
We celebrated our son's 10th birthday at Chilli's @ Central, Clarke Quay. Everything went very well and it was one of our best birthday experience. The service, ambience and food was well above expectations. I made the reservation one day prior, requesting for a nice cosy corner for our family. And indeed we were given a lovely table (I recalled speaking to "Madhi" for the reservations). When we arrive, everything went smooth, the staff were all very smiley, happy, attentive and courteous. Our server Jeanette was really fantastic, she made some good suggestions for the food and everything was done promptly and served efficiently. Food portion was good, the ribs and chicken sandwich were amazing ! The loveliest surprise was that Jeanette & Sasha prepared the candles on the cake (which I brought) and they sang the birthday song (with another lady staff whom I did not get the name) for my little boy. He was blushing but very happy to be treated so special. And making this occasion even more special and beautiful, we realized that kids ate free and there was NO service charge ! Thank you very much Chilli's and everyone at Central. We were also given a free brownie which was a really nice sweet gesture.. I will definitely return to Chilli's and highly recommend this restaurant esp for family get-together
3
I visited Chili's on a Saturday night for dinner with my partner. The place was crowded but we were still ushered in quickly to an available seat.We ordered a Strawberry Lemonade after seeing it was a Recommended item in the menu, together with a Blackberry Tea. The S'berry Lemonade was a very sour drink that you probably won't chug more than a mug despite the fact that it's a "Bottomless Beverage" (free flow). The Blackberry Tea was much nicer (I think this should have been the Recommended drink instead!).We also ordered a Southern Smokehouse Burger, and a Mushroom Alfredo Pasta.While I understand that Chili's is a place for meats and grill items, it was still a disappointment for the pasta (penne), because the penne was all clumped together like a bundle of logs. The mushroom however was pretty average.The Southern Smokehouse Burger (beef), while delicious-tasting with the charred edges (just the right amount, I think), had an awful presentation. The lettuce was slopped with the mayonnaise all around the sides of the burger - it didn't look like the lettuce was overflowing from the burger, but was instead haphazardly strewn all over and around the plate *after* the burger had been placed onto the plate. The string onions were deep fried dark brown, a sign of overfried (or the oil hadn't been changed much), and it was also strewn all over the plate, around the burger and amongst the fries (I thought it should go only on top of the burger as it was not a side but part of the burger?).The music in the background was a tad too loud however, so I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a dinner with your partner (and kids especially!) Despite the rowdy ambience, the patrons were still coming into the restaurant (mostly expats, presumably American) with as families with children.The server came by our table when we were done with our food, and asked if we'd like to order anything else. When we said we were good, we were promptly given the bill for settlement. A tad too outright (and embarrassing) for us.I did notice their PoS had a timer allocated to each cover - seems like the restaurant needed to keep track of how long each patron had entered the restaurant for some reason or another.I may return to this restaurant again, but definitely not with my family
4
Excellent Service + Attentive to replace the One Half Tough Ribs with a Cheerful Smile ...Our Orders of Double Ribs / Egg Rolls / Chicken Wings + Strawberry Drink ...Will be at The Tanglin Mall Outlet Again *Cheers & Keep it Up 
1
Bad service (inattentive, unresponsive), extremely loud music (which might be ok when the workers are alone but not when people try to eat and perhaps talk) and just lousy food. The children's food is barely better looking and tasting (I suppose) than discount dog food, the grilled fajitas are not only bland and microwaved, they have not even been near a grill. I'll stop here to avoid remembering the rest of disgusting grub we were served. And it's not even cheap
4
We had a good time dining there with friends and family. The nachos and ribs were geat. Huge size and complimentary drinking water reminded me to dine in America. lovely staffs!
4
Great place, good attentive waiters. Most probably the best Chili's in Singapore. Food is great, chair layout gives you much privacy. We liked the place very much.
Always had as good experience here. Definitely worth the visit!
1
Tanglin Chili's informed me the grille closed at 930 even though there published store hours are until 10pm. I was there at 945pm and refused service. I have been going to this Chili's since they opened in 2009 and this will be my last visit. Very disappointing Chiiis'; hour your store hours or change them!!! I will be spending my time and money at Dan Ryan's moving forward sad to say
4
The last time I dined at Chili's was during my college days in Manila and we went to Chili's Makati City. To my surprise the taste never changed eversince and it's exactly the same as the one they serve here in Singapore! Now that's amazing.Other than the chips, we had:Triple Dipper - the honey chipotle wings are great; the burgers are juicy.Mushroom Alfredo - the serving was good for twin-share, and the garlic bread is a bit soft, but still nice
4
Whilst staying at the Traders Hotel we decided to check this branch of Chili's out as it was in the neighbouring Tanglin Mall.Having previously dined with the chain in the US and UK we knew the type of Tex Mex fare to expect and weren't disappointed. Service was extremely efficient and course timings were perfect. Our bottomless soft drinks were replenished with no prompting. We had Southwestern Egg rolls and Texas Fries for starters. Both dishes were served in the same style and portion size as the US and tasted just as good. The main courses impressed also and were super sized, but this is a positive as Chili's isn't the venue to visit for those dieting or watching the calories. The atmosphere and furnishings meant the branch could of been lifted straight from the US.Overall a great experience and delivered the same food quality and service as delivered in other branches.
5
We are satisfied regular customers who always coming back every month. The food is excellent! Started with bowl of chili with tortilla chip and chicken nachos. Fully enjoying the honey chipotle chicken tender or mix and match ribs. Superb!Antonio and hamdan really a good server. They have passion on what they doing. Get discount from Passion card or online survey
4
It's a chain restaurant from American, so you know what you are getting. The staff were really friendly and after going there for food the first night, went in for a drink each night till I left. Took me an age to choose as so many options. Eating native food I think is overrated sometimes, if you are holiday have what you want
5
I am from the U.S and I get home sick. Chilis is the place to go for my favorite all American food. Loves the burgers and the appetizers. Love having the game on or watching NFL channel.
3
One has to realize that almost all chains in Singapore suffer from poor quality overall, slow service and bland food ... when you compare them to their counterparts across the world. The focus here is Asian cuisine and such. So, when you consider you that, this Chilis is average. Portions smaller than US and food not as well prepared ... but, if you need a Chilis fix, it will do. You go there once every six months or so ... you regret it, vow never to come back ... six months later, rewind, repeat ...
4
Despite being over three quarters full our order for chicken fajitas and shrimp quesadillas was delivered within a very short time. Portion sizes were more than adequate and it was a struggle to finish them. Pity because the desserts looked quite tempting! Staff very friendly and attentive
5
i simply LOVE chili's their skillet queso is the best ever a must have!
their country fried chicken is also very delicious the chicken cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes with skin simply divine but mixed with the country style gravy turned heavenly!
2
Went there once, no need to return. You want a cold beer and a snack- save yourself the $ and stop at 711.

I was really wanting Chili's Fajita's, and we headed out to Tanglin.I ordered the Citrus Fire Chicken and Shrimp Fajita's - hold the shrimp.Hubby ordered the country fried chickenMy fajitas did not come sizzling - the iron was touchable after assembling the first fajita. I would think that these were made previously for someone else, but sent to me. As well, there was no fire. NONE. I am sure I paid extra $$ for the regular chicken fajitas, served pre-cooled. There was no hot sauce, no cayenne, no jalapenos, nothing fiery. I have never had this dish before, it is new to the menu, so I have nothing to compare it to, but if you want spice, do not order this.Hubby's mash potatoes were cold, and the corn uneaten - it seemed like it had soaked all day in water and was over cooked and soggy.This is the first time we have had such poor meals at this locale. I hope this is not a trend, or we will not be back
3
Usually very crowded with long lines and popular with expatriate families. Noisy ambience so don't go there if you're wanting a quiet meal!The burger was a disappointment - large slab of overdone tough meat in a too soft bun. Cheese fries and the cup of chili with nachos were great. Beef fajitas were sinewy and overcooked. The herb salmon was not as succulent as expected.However it all washed down well with pints of beer in frosted mugs.Leave space for the Chocolate Molten cake which was rich and delicious - The chocolate shell over the vanilla ice-cream was super
3
This was the my first visit to Chili's: Tanglin Mall branch. The Happy Hour margaritas (2 for 1) were good and the broccoli was steamed nicely but they ruined a $40 NY Strip steak by cooking it in margarine - nasty taste. The service was friendly. To be fair the kids in the group really enjoyed it so they will be returning .... I might give it another try but I won't order the steak. To be fair this isn't really the sort of food I enjoy .... Lots of frying and cheese
4
We are almost regulars at Tanglin Mall Chili's so it must be ok for us to keep going back.The kids love most of the children's meals, particularly the ribs and like the top up of drinks. I usually have the chicken bbq salad which is mostly excellent. We have learnt to go on nights when the happy hour suits me for beer, otherwise it is very expensive. Service is generally excellent, but sometimes lets them down, mainly on drinks. My main concern is the confusion on specials. I have worked out the happy hours but the kids eat free seems to come and go with no warning. They also ask you to fill out a survey to get 10% off next time, but will not give you the discount if you use the happy hour or kids eat free, so don't bother with the survey. On Fridays they have Thursday night USA football and baseball on TV, almost live

After having all the Japanese, Chinese, Hawkers, Thai food experiences, these Westerners we happy to find some food we were familiar with. All the other experiences we would not have wanted to miss but having said that we are glad we did not miss Chili's either. The food was exactly as we had expected and are familiar with in the States and very yummy. The service was a little lacking as it took about 20 minutes to get the last of 6 orders after the first 2 came out. Also, there was an Ice Skating Rink outside the restaurant and a hockey game going on so it was a little loud but also added to the experience

For American chain-style diner food, Chili’s is actually my favorite place in Singapore. The food is better than Hard Rock, and the variety is better. You won’t be writing postcards home about your experience here, but for that burger and/or Tex-Mex craving, I don’t think you’ll find better than Chili’s. By Singapore standards (where delicious food is so affordable), its not cheap --- but it’s comparably priced to other similar restaurants.And the kids meals were generously portioned and much better quality than other kids meals I’ve seen

It is always sad when a good burger joint lose's it's way. For some time Chilli's was a staple of ours, being a reliable choice when we wanted a great plate or ribs, fajita's or a decent burger, washed down with a tasty margarita or a cold beer, in a plastic mug. For years we enjoyed this combination - despite the cheesy 'happy birthday' sing-along's being sung out of tune every 15 minutes by the staff. But over recent times, the place has lost its way.The food is still pretty good. But the non-cooked stuff is looking more and more pre-prepared, which leaves you wondering how long it sits in the back of their fridge. The fajitas served to me tonight were fine - but the accompanying cheese, sour cream and tomato plate was almost frozen, the second time this has happened. And the wraps were either not fresh, or over microwaved. My wife's ribs were unusually spicy, which was not as per menu.The drinks service, however, is where the place is going to ruin. 15 minutes to wait for a drinks order? then it takes 10 minutes after the chase? No need for plastic mugs if you serve that slow. And every-time you ask for anything (drink, toothpick, whatever), the waiters insist of radioing the request on their lapel microphone, albeit the barman was 6 feet from our table. Orders were missed and service was average.Still serves great ribs and burgers, but standards have definitely slipped

if you like tex mex and do not have an option like this in your hometown or have never had the cuisine before then please do visit. having said that i think it is more texan cuisine than tex mex. staff is very very friendly and helpful. the place is mostly crowded. it is a little at the end of the tourist trail (at the very end of orchard road - the other side to the istana / plaza singapura). otherwise pretty standard and average stuff. if you are craving for a cheeze overload then this is where you should go. a little USA in Singapore

We went here pretty late at night and found the place was still busy. The service was relatively fast and the food good and reasonably priced. The restaurant has a relaxed and casual atmosphere which was also good.

The food at this restaurant is very good. I have eated before at the Sentosa Resorts branch. Enjoyed the Molten Cake dessert, but one to share for 2 people is good enough.

Very bad service - had to wait for 45 minutes to be served and another 15 mins for the bill even after reminding several times - although they are very fast in saying sorry, they don't try to improve the service - food is ok

I love restaurants with some sort of background or history... and Chili's has it in abundance. I have been to Chili’s at 4 locations, Jakarta (Indonesia), New Delhi (India), Kuala Lampur (Malaysia) and Singapore. And true to its promise, Chili’s is the same (well almost) everywhere I have been. The same type of ambiance and the similar tasting signature dishes. Wanting to find out more about this “Western Restaurant” in heart of Asia, as the locals often call it, I was fascinated to read that from its humble beginning in Dallas in 1975 as yet another burger-joint, to an informal, full-service dining restaurant with over 1400 casual dining restaurants across the world, this chain has a seen a delicious journey indeed.The menu… Chili’s offers a long list of items on its menu, and their serving size is decently large too. I almost always get carried away and order more than necessary… and I am really not a fan of taking back left overs. Having said that, here are a few of my favourites at Chili’s that deserve a tasting.My favourite pick of food: [1] Tripper Dipper[2] Chili[3] Oldtimer burger[4] Molten Chocolate cake... must try... even if you don't try anything else!!! What's more, you can pick up the phone and order from chili's at any time... and their delivery is quite good. I have also ordered chili's using the online delivery service in Singapore called foodpanda, and it was quite an awesome experience to have home delivered chili's! For more information on the menu and my favourite pick... visit my blog: http://spicerover.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/78

Chili's grill and bar made rapid expansion into different areas of Singapore since they first started. The price of the food put me off trying the restaurant until I saw their Lunch Promotion. The lunch promotion starting at $14, $15 and $16 is definitely worth the money. It comprises soup or salad, a main course and free flow drinks. Though the portion of the lunch promotion is smaller, it is enough to fill the stomach.The quality of food is really good. The quesadilla is really divine. Service is a little slow though. But the staff are polite. If you do not mind paying a bit more for better quality of food, it is a must-go-to place. Look out for their lunch promotions and happy hour for 1 for 1 alcoholic drinks

I love going to Chili's, the overall experience is so upbeat and you always come back happy! I was craving for a full veg meal and they delivered it to the T. I ordered Veg Fajitas and it was mouth watering, I polished off everything on my plate, and every lick was worth it. I also tried their mango mojito and it was as refreshing as a drink can be! A must try

I don't often spend a lot on food, but when I do, this is one of the places on my lists. And the best part of it all, I don't actually have to spend a lot to enjoy some classic good fare. And it's not just the classics, they regularly update their menu with nice surprises and new twists to traditional favourites. I love practically everything on the menu it's hard to tell you what to go for. I'm a big fan of all of their starters which are just perfect for sharing. Lately, I have fallen for the Egg Rolls! The baby back ribs is probably one of the best in Singapore. Go for the caesar salad too if you fancy something light to start with because it's packed with chicken and bacon pieces!Overall, a great place to wind down a busy week with simple good food. Because I usually visit with my family, we don't get drinks, but when we're in the mood and if the Happy Hour promotion of the day (yes, there's a different promotion every day of the week now) suits us, we sure don't mind

We were looking hardly to find international food like chili's in our first nights in Singapore and we finally found one in Clark Que. It is totally different than the original taste and dishes of Chili's and when we asked them they said we have to adapt with the people taste in Singapore!No enchilada soup, no chicken wraps and many other nice dishes.So, if you want to have the original taste go to other fast food restaurants sch as Mcdonaldos

All-things meaty and American! The sumptuous ribs were full of flavour by we're boiled then baked, making the meat too tender for my liking. Burgers were juicy and stuffed with bacon and quite a feat to finish. At the end, you Must go for the lava cake.. Soft but firm and flowing out comes the chocolate lava, mmmmm. Service was amazing, and we even got a free Birthday Brownie with candle and song to boot !! Oh, be sure to book ahead before hoping to find a table

We popped in here for lunch on a saturday. We got seated quickly, and the waiting staff were all fairly helpful.I had the fajita triple, and couldnt actually taste the difference between the 3 ingredients. My friend had the boneless buffalo wings which also tasted v average. These foods all came up before the soup he had ordered for starters had arrived (which we had to ask for 4 times
5
We come to Singapore at least once a month and always make a trip to Chili's. It's authentic American food with a kick. Do not miss the pulled pork sandwich. Everything is delicious.

I visited Chili's nearby Traders Hotel with a friend. Great food delivered by a great and service minded staff. Highly recommended.

Lots of choices from the menu!The herbal salmon I had was overdone but they took it back n did it right the 2nd timeLong wait to get a table n for food to be served However, the staffs were so helpful n friendlyWorth a try

PRO:~Tasty western food.~Wide selection of drinks.~Good service.CON:~Not value for money.~Portions maybe big for Asian eaters

Went to Chili's for the first time as we were at Tanglin Mall. It was quite late for lunchtime ( nearly 2pm) but it was packed. Luckily we didn't have to wait long for a table.The food in the menu looked so good we had no choice but to pick only some of what we thought sounded and looked yummy- if they were good, we'll go back again.The pulled pork sandwich was so delicious I ate all the onion strings even thought I always take them out- the bun was warm and lightly toasted and the meat was so tender and moist.The side order of mash with pepper gravy is simply/sinfully divine!!The Triple Dipper is a great choice for those who can't decide which starter to order.On top of the great food, what really make us want to go back is Tony (short of Antonio) I think. He's one of the best service staff I've ever met- always cheerful with a smile and so attentive- everytime just as our glasses became empty, he offered to top it up. And it's not like he's standing there observing our glasses, he's constantly moving to the other tables, serving the other patrons, cleaning up etc. We were definitely impressed.We definitely will return, as we had such a great experience.Thumbs up

We went to Chili's tonight as my daughter loves the ribs there - and they are fantastic! I had the pulled pork sandwich which was delicious and my hubbie had the fajitas which were also excellent. The only problem with Chili's is that it gets really hectic around 6.00pm (especially on weekends) and with lots of screaming kids. As a result the service can suffer greatly. Tonight though we were well looked after and will return at some point in the future

Our office is just nearby, so this is always a place of choice for any celebrations.Went there recently for a birthday lunch, food is generously portioned and pretty quick if it isn't during the peak timing.Staff are also friendly and engage in small talk to ensure you are comfortable.The best part? A nice FOC brownie ice-cream for the birthday boy /ga

Chilli's food was great but then the que was 35 minutes long! I would recommend making reservations, but they don't do that. Unless you're very desperate to get tex-mex food, the wait isn't worth it. It had a nice view from the window-side tables
4
I was thrilled when I heard Chili's was opening up in Singapore a few years ago, and they did not disappoint. Probably my favorite US casual dining chain from the States does a great job with the food here as well - *and* good luck finding a bottomless Tostadas menu item anywhere else. Service is okay, the waitstaff are friendly if a tad overloaded. I've tried most of the menu and it's quite good overall. Location is ... well, not great in my opinion, it could have been closer to an MRT, but if you're up for a walk or a bus, it's doable, by car it's very accessible. Highly recommended

This is a franchise from the North American restaurant chain. The menu is consistent with the chain, and the food is good. Not all dishes translate perfectly from North America - fresh avocado is harder to get here, and being in Singapore, the prices are higher than normal. The service is ok, but you don't know who will be your server as they tend to hand-off throughout the meal. Still, this is a good restaurant when you want a taste of North American tex-mex

It's in the Tamblingan Mall nearby the Traders Hotel. Very busy on Friday night, we've gor the last table around 6.30pm. Great food.
3
The location inside Tanglin Mall is ideal if you're staying at Traders or Regis or any other nearby hotel. I had tea, appetizers and salads and all were fine.
2
I don't have a US palate. I couldn't deal with the sweet bacon. I couldn't deal with sweet ribs. I don't get salads drowning in creamy dressing (would you like lettuce with your ranch dressing?)
The fajitas were ok, but everything else was just confusing.
4
I had fajitas and my business colleague the beef salad. It all came well presented and with a great big smile. A happy place to eat, no pretence but good food and service. Get out of the mostly moribund hotel restaurants and eat here!
4
The food is actually much better than Chili's in America. The service is friendly and attentive. Best part is that kids eat free before 6pm. One of the best burgers I have had in Singapore, especially the avocado burger.
4
Very nice portions as well and wonderful margeritas. If you are staying at the St. Regis its just a 5 minute walk away to Tanglin mall.
5
Well known to US travelers with the same food as at home - kid friendly

I had dinner with my hubby at Chilis,Tanglin Mall last night. It was my 2nd time dine at Chilis. I tried Chilis at Sentosa last year and it was good.We ordered,1) Quesadilla Salad- Small $152) Herb Salmon $26Total Bill: $43.85*Healthy food.The salad was fresh and delicious! One of the best salad. Although the menu started it's 'small' but portion quite big and very fulfilling. Salmon also very fresh not overcook. The staff - Tony/ Antonio (can't remember his exact name) introduced himself while he's serving us. Very good, helpful and attentive service. This is the only restaurant that offered to leave behind 1 menu (incase I need to order again). Good job! Excellence! We’ll sure come back again. :)Other yummy *must try*:1) Triple Play (as starter - Chicken Crispers, Boneless Buffalo Wings and Southwestern Eggrolls with sauces for dipping.)2) Wings over buffalo3) Classic nachos 4) Molten chocolate Cake **MUST TR

LOVE CHILLIS - Foods always great , its really cheap as welli had a steak and a chicken burger the two trips i went and both were cooked to perfection , the man at the bar was very helpfull always topping my glass up - great experience at Chillis Singapore

My family had wanted good burgers for dinner and chose Chili's because we had good experiences there in the past. This time around was a bit of a disappointment. The first negative impression was at the entrance. The staff gave us two adult menus and two kids menus including crayons - a strange thing to do since there were no kids in our group. All our burgers were overdone - we asked for medium rare and they came well done. We were in a rush so didn't bother to return them to be redone. Table service staff was friendly, as usual. We'll give Chili's another try one day and hopefully, they will have addressed these two problems
