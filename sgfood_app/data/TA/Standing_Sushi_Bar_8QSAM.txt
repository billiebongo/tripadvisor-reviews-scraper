Excellent Japanese food quality and variety.
Rather pricey but 50% off on Tuesday’s .
Nice ambience for friends or solo meal.
A must try .

Standing sushi bar offers a good spread of Japanese cuisine. Though some dishes are overpriced, most of them are hits and highly recommended indeed!
3
Went on an evening when the restaurant was not crowded but food took a while to come and waiter not too attentive. The food was still as good as always.
5
Read reviews before booking a table. Service was attentive and food was good - if not excellent. And yes, they gladly took my money.
No, we did not have to stand.
Go discover.

Excellent service by Yvonne and Crystal. Delicious and quality food - compliments to the Chefs and team.

My friend and I went to Standing Sushi Bar on 3rd August 2017 for my birthday celebration. The food was of excellent quality, served hot and fast! Excellent service crew and very polite! Keep up the good work!
4
Long queue during dinner time, as usual. Better to make reservation first. If not expect an hour wait. Food was good, however at the steeper end.
3
Food was decent. I ordered the Oyako Don set, which was very wet (not soupy by soggy) with gravy, but not exactly ‘umame‘. Chicken was tender. Service was friendly and rather attentive. Family ordered other things but weren’t impressed either. Not exactly the best value for money, but not exorbitantly priced
2
Was recommended to try the establishment by a number of colleagues, which was the main restaurant of this visit. Ordered a chirashi don along with the salmon belly sushi. Both were underwhelmingly disappointing despite the hefty price tag. I would imagine their daily promotions would do better in attracting hordes of customers with little or no discerning palates
5
One of the very few places I know of that sells white tuna sushi!!!! The other sushi are also very fresh! Not the cheapest place for sushi, but quality never disappoints and is highly recommended. Chawamushi and onsen eggs are also very smooth and nicely done
4
They have a weekend promo which is amazingly great in value, delicious and simple. Loved the hand-roll maki. The sake promo was great too as it offered a complementary oyster (2 pieces for 330 ml)
4
We were looking for a place for a pre wedding drink bar and saw this joint next to hotel royal. Quite a nice place for snacks and happy hour.
3
The atmosphere was the place is pleasant and comfortable.
The food is average though. We went on a Tuesday where there's half price for certain sashimi. I wouldn't have paid for it if its full price.
3
Food is on the expensive side ... but sashimi was quite fresh.
Worth a visit if around the area and when they are having promotions.
4
Visited on a Wednesday where there was the speciality roll promotion of 50% off list price, $2 cold sake, $5 asahi/plum wine/hot sake. Awesome deal! The sushi and sashimi is always fresh whichever the day of the week!The under the sea roll and magic dragon rolls were awesome! Ingredients vs rice proportion feels generous and not packed with rice like some chain sushi restaurants. I will always return to try their different promotions. Tues is 50% off sashimi and nigiri sushi. Mon thurs is $3 for 5 slices of salmon. And sun is up to 50% off donburi. There's always smthg for everyone :)
3
Came to the Standing sushi bar with a group of friends in the evening after work. Don't forget to make a reservation as there seems to be a perpetual queue. The restaurant has various discounts and bargain buys on different days, check on their website for further details. Food served was average for it's price. The place serves a decent variety of sashimi and other japanese food, with a penchance of deviating towards the Singaporean palate. Usually frequented by office workers in the evening and students after lunch
4
Monday and Thursday, salmon sashimi is quite cheap. However, if I order 20-25 slices, around 5 slices are quite disgusting with all those veins and it doesn't taste fresh, needless to say that it does not have that scent of salmon. To avoid it, I order around 10 pieces each, so they cannot just sneak in some.. "lower than the expectation" pieces. Though, it's relatively cheap 5 slices for 3 SGD excluding GST and service charge. It's worth the trip.Location is just nice, right beside Bras Basah MRT Station. This place is very crowded. So if you go there at around 7pm, you will have to expect a very long queue.As there are not so many servers, it will take some time for them to get to you. Overall, I'd still recommend this restaurant for cheap price (for Salmon sashimi
4
Went for their $3 for 5 sashimi promotion on a Thursday. It's a simple modern Japanese place. Service was good despite the place being packed. We had a reservation so we didn't queue (got quite long, understandably). We got 10 orders of the sashimi and two orders of seafood fried rice. Both were great! Worth a try even without the promotion for an excellent dinner
4
We reserved a table here on a Thursday night because of their popular promo on Salmon Sashimi. While walking to the resto we saw a long queue so it helps to reserve in advance. The restaurant had a nice modern Japanese look to it which gave off the impression that the food will be quite pricey. We availed of their promo and ordered a total of 10 orders of Salmon sashimi and two orders of Seafood Fried Rice. We got our orders shortly after and I must say that the food was excellent. There were a lot of waiters so there was no trouble having your needs attended to despite the place being full. I'm recommending this to anyone looking to satisfy their craving for Japanese food in the area
4
So apparently the place was booked out for the whole week so we decided to patronise the place after 8pm. The wait was less than 20 mins and we were promptly ushered to our seats. All the staff seemed exhausted due to the amount of people on the Monday madness but they still put up a smile, which is commendable. The food came less than 15 mins and sure, it is fresh and hot (except for the salmon skin which is obviously over deep fried).Salmon promotion was great as usual and of course, we had a great time
4
you can find really good deals, the noodles (spaghetti) with Japanese sauce are perfect. Crowd is young, service average, price cheap for drinks and special offers. Good sushi too.
4
Great stop for a quick drink and dinner after work, excellent sashimi, ice cold beer, a little slow service but well worth a visit.
3
I tried this sushi bar because of the high rating and positive and my hotel was nearby.
Pros:
+ Decent sashimi and sushi
+ Service is okay
Cons:
- Noodle and the meat and the broth were terrible
- Noisy
- Old and confusing menu
4
Great value for 5 pieces of salmon. The offer is only available on Mondays 1700 - 2045 (closing time) though. The sushi rice complements the sashimi well but is a tad expensive at $4 a bowl. Also, go there for the food, don't expect good service; it was below average.

I am such a maki addict!!! & I can never be more thankful when Standing Sushi bar came about with their beautiful selection of maki rolls. Awesome and creative use of familiar ingredients put together in so many unexpected ways.Loooove loooove looooove their 50% off speciality rolls on Wednesdays that really give me the run of my money.Haaaaate hate hate because I am usually here not on a Wednesday!!Loving their newly launched range of chawan mushi. So colorful & vibrant. So want them all!! & they are all so "Instagramable".Thank you for still being an awesome joint I still want to visit after so many years

2nd time visiting Standing Sushi Bar although I always walked past it on route to dance classes for the past 3 years!Finally had the chance to visit the place with a friend who is gaga over Asahi, sashimi and sushi. Initially we thought that there would be a long Q on a weekday night given the wonderful promotions which take place everyday are too good to miss out for Jap food and beer lovers!However, the haze condition probably deterred people from Q-ing and we were lucky to get a place at the bar table immediately.It was Wed night which means rolls were 50% discount and we dove straight to ordering 3 types of rolls to share along with 2 Asahis. Decided to grab a platter of mixed sashimi upon recommendation from the server and boy oh boy, 1 of the sashimi was the best I had in Singapore. Unfortunately I didn't managed to catch the name of the sashimi but would definitely recognized it from the menu again.It was a great evening of Asahi beer, awesome rolls and sashimi
1
My friend and I got diarrhoea after eating here. It didn't come as a surprise though. Their pipes overhead where we were seated were leaking and we only realised the liquid dripping onto our plates halfway through the meal. Plates of sashimi were stacked on top of each other when being carried to the tables with the bottom of some plates touching some slices of sashimi
1
I went there with other 2 friends for dinner. However only me and another one came early and we started to queue and wait for my friend to come. The queue was very long and when it came to us (after 30-45 mins), the staff told us that we were only allowed to get in when 3 of us all presented. We agreed and wait at the end of the queue again. We queue for another 1 hour and when it was our turn to get it,the staff shout loudly from inside that there's no more salmon without any apologies or anything. They should have been a little more flexible to let people in instead so that we did not have to wait until my one last friend came. I have wasted more than 2 hours on that night for nothing. To be honest, Standing Sushi Bar did offer pretty good price for sashimi, however it is just a little bit lower (a few dollars) than other better quality Japanese restaurants such as Itacho. It's is definitely not worth it to spend so much time here :

The title is not meant to be a joke, but I think plenty of people will be like me to have a misconception that this sushi bar only has standing seats.The sushi and sashimi here is fresh. I always like my sashimi to cut in thick slice and served cold, which they did both. I like their wide range of maki roll which makes me spoilt for choices. I can't remember which one I have ordered but I do remember both rolls suits my taste well. Overall a satisfying experience. Tips: be prepared to queue for your table if u have not make any reservations. Come early so that the place isn't so crowded by the after office crowd.

Upon reading upon all the highly-recommended reviews on The Standing Sushi bar, me and my friend have decided to visit the outlet at Income @ Raffles. We looked through the official website and the promotions section. The seasonal chirashi don really caught our attention and it was the main reason why we decided to make a trip down. Despite asking the service staff if we will be serving the exact chirashi don as in the picture (we showed him the picture) and getting confirmation from him, we got a "chirashi don" that looked really different. Being really puzzled and curious, we asked the service staff and this time round, he said, "oh, different outlets have different presentations because of different chefs". I guess, probably, photo representation of the food should be provided and more accurate description/information should be presented to the customers. Furthermore, the sashimi are sliced up to cubic shapes and in very different and disproportionate shapes. It is definitely not a satisfying, but disappointing meal. I guess you can give a miss on the chirashi don.

The set dinners are excellent and have a perfect combination of sushi, with side items.
The promos on Tues and Thurs lead to lineups.
This is a safe pick for quality sushi.
4
Had a casual business lunch here with a colleague from overseas. (lunch) Set meals were affordable and a good variety.
Good for lunch!
4
We had great sushi and the price for it was also good. Unfortunately it was very full so that we had to wait and only hot a seat at the bar.
5
Large menu..!! Lots of choices...! Great deals (on selected days). Hot Sake was great..!! pretty busy place on Monday evening. But Tuesday evening was not that crowded. Enjoyed the every bite of their food..!!
NOTE: check their set menu. You'll find excellent dishes there..!!
5
The food variety is great! the rolls are excellent, sushi/sashimi is always fresh!
But don't come on days when they're having salmon sashimi $3 promotion nights.. unless you're willing to stay in queue for a while.
Otherwise, great food, great service.
we love it!

This was my 2nd visit, but the first time with the family, and after a visitto the nearby Art Muse. We had 2 bento boxes and some noodles, none of which was particularly exciting. Service was efficient but emotionless. There were only 3 tables occupied at lunch on a Saturday
1
Don't think it is worth the wait. Queued for 1 hour and when we went in, the place is so squeezy. 3 of us was seated at a 2 people table. One of the seats block the passage lane. It totally annoys me because after waiting for one hour, the next thing I will like to do is just to have a peaceful meal. The staffs keep hitting onto my chair whenever they walk that passage way. Requested for a change of seats but they refuse to. Asked the staff to remove the seats beside me (the other table that block the passage way) and they refuse to do so as well. The sashimi (thurs madness 5 for $3) was not very fresh. Yes, it is a good deal but it is totally not worth the wait. The staff were also not very friendly and helpful. We have to request for water twice before it was being served.Worst, a plain bowl of sushi rice cost $3.50!!! And pls do not forget about 10% service charge and 7 % GST. $4 for a bowl of sushi rice. No sesame, nothing
4
A wonderful noisy place packed to the brim until closing. Had to wait outside for a table despite our late arrival time, but the bargain sashimi and drinks deals were well worth it.Amazing melt-in-the-mouth sashimi, extremely efficient, cheerful service -- all round a very positive experience
4
This sushi bar is famous for their sushi rolls and weekday special offers (half price sushi, really cheap yet fresh sashimi etc). Without the offers, prices are quite steep so I only patronize on weekdays! Unfortunately, no reservations accepted and you can expect long, snaking queues outside the restaurant
4
Located at 8QSAM, it is very centrally located. You can get there via the MRT or the bus. The food at Standing Sushi Bar is very good and almost every item on the menu is delicious! You can try almost anything there. They have a few special items so make sure you try them!
4
Came here for dinner & food is really good! Quick service too! Will definitely be back for more yummy food! :)
5
The place is amazing , be ready to wait,They say good things come with patience.And yes the food is amazing, Salmon Sushi is mouth watering.....
5
hidden of a little corner of Queen street , opposite the Royal hotel
Quick service and then yummiest sushi, a line outside to get a spot around 6 pm
4
They have promos on Tuesday - 50% off. So it was a really good deal.
Do make reservations otherwise be prepared to wait for awhile.
I love the Sushi. Bento sets was so-so.
Sashimi was fresh, considering the price im paying it is good value.

This time round, Edison*, Katherine*, Zachery* decided to head to Standing Sushi Bar for dinner. Inspired by standing sushi bars in Japan, the flagship outlet of Standing Sushi Bar at One Raffles Place was a true standing concept - as in, diners would stand and eat literally.However, the new, bigger, outlet that we visited at 8 Queen Street #01-03 Singapore Art Museum, Singapore 188535 had evolved into the usual Japanese restaurant with tables and chairs. It was more comfortable all right, for us to enjoy high-quality, healthy and affordable Japanese food in a warm, hearty and vibrant environment. The number to dial is 6333 1335.The Sushi Udon Set was complete with springy udon noodles in sumptuous miso broth, and tasty sushi made of fresh ingredients. This is a dream set for any diner who covets a bowl of hot, tasty, thick noodles followed by an assortment of good sushi and sweet watermelon slices.I had the Sashimi Set - with the freshest shrimps, salmon, tuna, swordfish and squid in raw forms - very chewy with bounciness, and palatable for sure. I loved it.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/dinner-at-standing-sushi-bar.htm

Came here for lunch recently. Sushi is decent, although more expensive than comparable places such as Itacho Sushi. Didn't try the lunch sets but these looked like they offered better value than the sushi. Next time I visit I will try one of the set lunches. Overall bill for 2 people for 10 pieces of sushi, 2 hand rolls, 2 miso soup, hot tea and some gyoza was $68 SGD, which seemed relatively poor value for money
4
I've only ever been to SSB 8QSAM on Mondays and Thursdays, for the sashimi promotion. The sashimi tastes fantastic (the soya sauce tastes wonderful too). The salmon aburi was okay (though my friends loved it). If you are't going for the promotions, the food is overpriced and you can get nice sushi for way cheaper elsewhere. So just go for the promotions. Go slightly before 6 or else the queue will form. I would give this 5 stars if we didn't have to remind the waiters 3 times for the bill. Otherwise, service is efficient and the food comes really quickly
4
This place is located at the side of SAM. This place is small and quite crowded so you might want to make reservations. The food have very creative names such as "Puff the Magic Dragon". Their specialities are sashimi and sushi so make sure you order that. The prices are quite reasonable too so I would highly recommend this restaurant
3
The food is great! Ordered cheese salmon belly, salmon belly mentai, prawn dragon roll, duck meat. All is great except the duck meat which Taste normal. Other than that, sushi is great. Unagi sushi (2pcs) is $10. So it's considered pricey as compared to other restaurants. But hey, they've got good sushi, so it's fair.Service is not so good though.. When we came in, we were not ushered to a seat. So we choose seats ourselves. And the short hair in specs waitress gave a solemn stern face, points and say: "you can either sit there or there. Not here." If you don't seat your guest, you should be polite and help us to an assigned table NICELY. And not point at other seats with you standing 2m away. That puts us off..The service staff DON'T smile at all. Not a single one smiled. So if u had a bad day and looking for great service, this place won't be ideal. The good food saved them.

First visit to this much talked about place. First off, the direction and parking is easy. The medium sized outlet is bustling, and the food served within 15mins of ordering, and we have 50% off sushi/sashimi cos its Wednesday. That makes the sashimi about avg restaurant pricing. Did not like the sukiyaki hotpot cos the beef already cooked in the pot when served. That makes it a little over cooked. The soup base is a tad over sweet. Others r good
4
The outlet at Marina Bay Link Mall would be a better place to dine at. Friendlier Staff makes the visit more enjoyable
4
Food was good! Yaki Udon I ordered had lotsa ingredients.Spicy Tuna Maki was good & satisfying!The bento sets with mackeral, salmon was great too! Mackeral is sweet and fresh. Eel was well barbecued as well. However, the waiters need more training as their service could definitely be improved. They were overstaffed as well
4
Tried out their hand roll & sushi lunch sets, as well as chawanmushi and torched salmon maki.Very decent quality and quantity for their prices.The aburi (torched) sushi was particularly good, with an interesting lemony sweet & sour & creamy sauce.I also liked the complimentary salad that comes with every lunch set.A bit crowded on a weekday's lunch though, the food took a while to arrive
4
Ordered the mixed sashimi and a California roll. The pieces of fish weren't exceptionally large, but they were fresh and flavorful. The roll was very good. 12 pieces of fish, a roll, and 2 beers = 60sgd. Service was prompt and friendly. It's not a particularly stylish interior, but definitely a place I'd return to when I need a quick sushi fix

@8Q SAM outleti eat here often and i would say the Japanese food are really fresh especially the sashimi. i love salmon sashimi best and i would always order it. the chef cuts the fresh sashimi in thick slices which gives your mouth something to chew and savour on. Also, if you order the nigiri sushi, the rice given is smaller compared to other Japanese Restaurants where there is a huge amount of rice followed by the sashimi topping.coming to the Bento sets, I've tried:Katsu Don(consists of pork), Tonkatsu Don(consists of pork), Yakiniku (consists of beef), Oyako Don (consists of chicken). the sets are rather filling for me as they come with rice. for guys who are rice eater, i doubt it would be filling.my friend tried the Sushi Udon(assorted nigiri) i think 7 different nigiri? but i think it is not worth it even though the set comes with udon, its plain simple udon without any meat - simply udon and soup!if you are Maki lovers, i suggest you order Shake Aburi. the chef torch the salmon giving it a half-cooked taste. moreover, the "special" sauce within the maki makes it heaven. i like the taste of the salmon. half-raw half-cooked. the top part that's burnt gives it a bbq smell while the bottom layer of the salmon retains its freshness of the salmon sashimi. i like it when i drink with some sake or Asahi! for those who are money savers or are thrifty yet wants a great sashimi feast, do go down on Monday for its Monday Madness!! u get discounts on salmon sashimi and alcohol.coming to the end about food, i would say their service isn't tip top even though their food is. to me, they lack of manpower.. in most occasions, the waitresses always take minutes! just to bring me to a table. not only that, even ordering and getting your bill, they take rather long just to complete a job.i'm also quite unsure if they charge for water - plain/ice water. there are times the waitresses told me they charge for water and at times, it's free?! i wonder does charging of water depends on their attitude? i didn't get to clarify this issue though.at this outlet, the ambience if not really great if you want to relax. there's a lot of other customers talking rather loudly and the chairs are not very comfortable to seat on.. (no sofas, if i remember correctly) all in all, i will go there for Japanese food and of course the sashimi!! i guess getting to eat great food, means you have to be patient about getting your seat and settling the bill
3
We've read good reviews of this place on tripadvisor and came there.But we didn't like it that much - the food is nothing special.The service also could be better (you need to call for the waitress for a several times).I know, that I didn't taste the dish of the lady in the neighborhood, but she was complainig that the meat she ordered consisted only of fat.We liked that outside the restaurant there is a round table for table-tennis, so that you could play after the meal
4
I've been to this outlet several times. On a Saturday, it will be extremely quiet. Quiet till I saw the servers sneaking a 'nap' cuz there is simply no customers!In short, Standing Sushi Bar offers one of the freshest sashimi at very affordable prices. And with credit cards promotions, it is a deal that most should not miss! Service is okay, sometimes need to prompt them to fill up the cup.... Otherwise, all is good
5
Ive been to Standing Sushi bar maybe 30 or so times, and always had a great experience there. The food is decent, value-for-money, always tasty and their sashimi is fresh. Plus drinks are good value too. They have some great quality sake bottles that are surprisingly easy on the wallet. I like the place so much I've even thrown my birthday party there - and service and food were both great.But they've gone and outdid themselves with their Monday promotions. Sashimi, sake and a bunch of other stuff are super cheap every Mon. Suffice to say a bellyfull of salmon and sake on a teensy bill made me and my friends a happy camper last mon. Plus, the friendly n good looking crowd don't hurt
5
This restaurant is a rare fine that does not get the attention it deserves. Their Japanese sets are real value for money, if I am not wrong, ranging from $15 to $25. Their sashimi is always fresh and tasty, and I have a particular fondness for their spicy salmon hand roll. I've ate here several times, as I live close to the restaurant. The only down side is that their a la carte menu does not seem to be that value for money. I've never ordered from the a la carte
5
I have a deep and important relationship with salmon sashimi. Like the frumpy girl who lived next door throughout childhood, I refused to give raw fish the time of day till my 20s. Then one day that girl turns up at Prom, lets her hair down, takes off her glasses, and thus begins the greatest love affair of my life. So it has been with salmon sashimi.The cooling, refreshment of gulping down that first luxurious piece of pink pleasure is one of life's great joys, and I found the best salmon sashimi in Singapore at Standing Sushi Bar.They have one outlet for the businessmen around the CBD, but I prefer the one at Queen Street neat the Art Museum.All of the fish and seafood is wonderfully fresh; prices are totally reasonable as Japanese restaurants go; and they do have seats and tables - don't be misled by the Standing name
