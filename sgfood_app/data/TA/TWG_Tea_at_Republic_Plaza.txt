I love visiting here when I am in Singapore. The service is amazing, the food is delicious, and the tea is unmissable!

Been visiting here for the past 7 years... Like an old friend.... Drinking my sexy tea and scones.... Many staff changes and now this place lost it charm....

A business colleague asked to meet up at TWG for an early-afternoon meeting. I was intrigued by the two short flights of stairs that took you up to the actual "tea room" - they had an "old-world" feel to them, as if we were ascending into an old-fashioned tea parlor of yesteryear. The tea room itself was actually quite small, but pleasant, and felt "quaint."The tea menu is astounding... I had no idea there even WERE that many teas in the world! It was a bit overwhelming, actually, so I asked the waiter to help select one given that I wanted decaffeinated. There were ample teas that fit the bill, and I landed on a Creme Caramel tea from South Africa. My business colleague wanted tea, too, but TWG doesn't stock soy milk (and my colleague is lactose intolerant), so she was disappointed and went with an orange juice instead.We also decided to each have a small scone. They were delicious, and the jam/jelly on top was outstanding - a mix of passion fruit with peach I believe? Anyway, they were delicious.The biggest downside of TWG were the prices... it cost us $35 for one orange juice, one tea, and two quite small scones. That's high, even by Singapore standards

A throwback experience to a more relaxed age. Tiny brasserie style eatery on a mezannine floor. Impeccable service from a very discreet and polished server (sadly I didn't catch his name). Beautiful decor. I enjoyed a croque monsieur and an iced tea and was very happy. Bang in the business district this is an elegant choice for a spot of lunch

Celebrated a friend's birthday lunch. Nice little cafe with plenty of privacy. Set lunch come with tea and dessert of your choice which is cake or pie. Food was nothing spectacular. Could have a better meal elsewhere at the same price. Anyway, never try, never know

July 27 was my Singapore travel last day. I went to TGW Public plaza with my friends.The afternoon tea was the best here, and the food was good both in taste and in visual. AND Ronald was very kind!! He is grate staff !!!! The dessert he recommended was the most delicious 'Amazing Singapore' I am grateful for guiding you to have a good time and would like to revisit if I go to Singapore again.

I ordered the marinated Wagyu beef and told the staff that I would like it to be braces-friendly. I am extremely happy when my meat came in soft bite-size cubes. The staffs are really accommodating I must say.Along with my main I also ordered my favourite Silver Moon tea to go along with it. It's silly to dine at TWG without ordering their tea!For my dessert, I went with the tea flavoured ice cream - Black Tea & Napoleon Te
5
We turned up for a high tea but because it was lunchtime they had a lunch menu instead. Although slightly disappointed we chose to stay and try the lunch menu. It was fantastic! You get a choice between two mains, a choice between two deserts and same for the tea. We had a green tea but there was an iced tea option too. The service was superb and at $42pp inc taxes it wasn't too bad on price either. Definitely worth a try

Quietly tucked away in Republic Plaza , I never knew there was a TWG here in the CBD area even though I come here often! Found this place cos I'm here for an internship interview today & decided I need to chill abit. Like all TWG branches , the ambience is classy & relaxing. Tried the Napoleon tea today at the suggestion of an attendant here by the name of "Zai". I've a sweet tooth & so I loved it. It went rly well with the macarons. :-) You guys should try it when you come here!But what motivated me to leave a feedback is the superb service of the staff, especially "Zai". Told him about my interview during our small talk and he was really friendly & encouraging, very much like an old friend. Such genuineness in customer service is honestly so rare these days. Given its price, TWG food may not be of the best quality .. but the service at TWG republic plaza is.Do pop in when y'all are around the area! :-)

Between the fragrant orange and cinnamon of the Christmas Tea, and the surprising flavor of the mint tea macarrons TWG tea offered some of the more memorable flavors of Singapore. The more standard varieties deliver what is expected, but each time I chose something unusual I was rewarded with something special. A real treat and a fantastic place for gifts
4
Excellent tea with May outlets and their own cafes. I recommend the Singapore breakfast tea but at $ 23 for 15 tea bags it is expensive
5
if you are a tea lover, then this is the place to go. the best tea shop and excellent food and dessert. the price is expensive but reasonable enough for its quality.
5
It was almost closed so that I could enter the shop without a line. I ordered tea set (pastry of the day) immediately. There are so many tea flavors but I choose common one because I was hungry and would like to eat soon. The staff service was excellent. This shop was founded in 1837 very long history, dining characteristics of tea bags being made of cotton. Expensive but exclusively high qualified tea is so surprised to me

Coming from the UK, we definitely have what can be defined as some of the best High Tea places in the world. TWG doesn't even come close to providing either the expected level of service or quality of food. My dining experience was thoroughly disappointing. The tea was tasty but I wouldn't say anything extraordinary. At the prices TWG sets, I would have expected more for my money. As for the pastries, they also left much to be desired.I unfortunately shan't be returning anytime soon. Felt slightly cheated from my money

We had dinner on 26th July 2015 at MBS2 TWG. Food was great but the service was bad. The staff were unfriendly and unapproachable. I have heard many bad reviews regarding the service until I experienced it myself. We ordered a pink garden tea and a sexy tea. When the tea was served to us, I questioned why the tea was pink since our tea was green tea base, it was only after my questioning that the staff admitted that they have served pink flamingo instead of pink garden. The tea was changed to pink garden afterwards. At the end of our dinner, I took a sip of my friend's sexy tea and realized it tasted exactly the same as my pink garden and when I asked the waiter about it, he said that they have served my friend the wrong tea as well. It is very disappointing and unprofessional for a tea salon to be serving customers the wrong tea. With such a wide selection of tea, how can a customer be sure he is being serve the right tea with this kind of irresponsible attitude from the staff? I sent an email to report the incident to the customer service and the customer service reply to me was that it was a busy Sunday for them??? I find the reply very amusing and unapologetic. It is definitely not a restaurant that I would recommend to anyone

The decor attracted me and I was after a light lunch, tea and a macaroon. I ordered a soup of the day (cream of onion soup with foie fras). The waiter recommended a green tea which I said yes to. The soup was very small (cappuccino cup size) and came less than luke warm. When i enquired about the heat of the soup, the waiter was trying to convince me that it was normal for soup with cream to be less than luke warm. I actually set it aside, at which time the waiter agreed to check with the kitchen. Finally I got a hot soup and it was ok (and for $10 plus tax). It turned out that the tea the waiter recommended was the most expensive tea on the menu - $22 (plus tax)! Admittedly I should have asked for the price first. It comes in a massive pot, but really it was a cup. The taste of the tea was nice but nothing better than what I have in my pantry, but the bill of $38 certainly was extraordinary. I couldn't be bothered getting a macaroon. Come here to pay for decor.

Went to the one at Marina Bay Mall.Pros:- classy decor and extensive tea menu- high quality tea and scones- quiet surroundings in generalCons:- elevated restaurant: hard to find the entrance- nowhere to hide from the scorching sun coming through the skyligh

Since the day TWG opened, I was very fascinated by their one-of-a-kind British luxury décor. Therefore, I decided to visit their outlet in MBS with my sister. To my surprise, their tea selections were really a lot, probably close to 100 or 200 types available and I didn't expect TWG would carry so many ranges of tea leaves. BUT the prices were much amazing than their tea varieties on the menu. It was ridiculously expensive. I am not certain if the prices are intended for foreign visitors, but we were quite shocked in fact. We could understand prices in such luxury hotel will be expensive but not to the extent of that. We ordered 2 pots of tea and 3 different desserts set. They costs about $85 in total and we didn't quite like the food because they didn't taste excellent or live up to the standards of what a luxury brand should be carrying. Overall it is really a true experience for me personally, it is still highly recommended to visit TWG!I didn't regret visiting TWG because their décor is really magnificent and special but the food and drinks didn't leave me much good impression. Price will be no issue for me (even expensive) if the food or drinks are worth the money, but in this case I was quite disappointed actually. Service by the "foreign" staffs were cold and normal, customers like us doesn't feel being warmly welcome and I saw they ignored some of the patrons waving hands and asking for bill settlements

Come on TWG. This was appalling. We ordered a tea set and got what amounted to some dry crumbs of pastries. The tea menu was exhaustive and a bit intimidating and confusing. This was pretend fine-dining. Service was good though. The staff are quite sharp and helpful

I have always enjoyed my experience in TWG tea salon and look forward to one opening in London or Paris one day.I overheard a very disappointed customer sitting next to me telling his partner that when ordering a tea set, there is a surcharge for any tea chosen over 250 baht (an additional 250 baht++ in fact). So if you ordered a tea for 270 baht you would be charged an extra 250++ baht (over $8.00) just for choosing a tea that cost 20 baht(.50c)more .May I strongly suggest that the difference that is charged for teas chosen over 250.00 is for the actual amount (or colour-coded at ait tiered rate perhaps) and please avoid charging a flat fee for those who wish to spend a little more than the 250.00 threshold. Not everyone after all choses the most expensive teas on offer. This wil be asure way to serve customers better and ensure they will return.

Went to Marina Bays Sands (On The Bridge) on 02/11/13 (Saturday) around 10pm. When are seated down we were browsing through the menu as we never been to TWG before the waiter kept standing behind us and looking waiting for us to order which makes us quite stress. After deciding we decided to order the pastries and its not stated that the price is for individual item thus we thought is a set menu. We told the Chinese looking waiter wearing specs that we want to order that and he suddenly raised his voice and said "the total is $45 for all that items" we was like huh? We thought its a set and you need not raise your voice till all the customers turn and look at us, you can just tell us. Its not as though we could not afford it. We felt so embarrassed & humiliated. I felt like throwing my credit card in his face! In the end we ordered a creme brulee ($12.90) for 2 pathetic small brulee, 4 macaroons which taste yucky and just sweet. ($8.00), 1 Banana crepe ($12.90), 3 pots of tea as we cannot share 1 pot we must order 1 pot each ($38.70). They asked us to pay the bill first as they are closing at 11pm but when we asked them they say they close at 11.30pm and as we are paying the bill they still serve new customers in...Total Bill when it arrived we were quite shock as it comes up to near $100. Totally not worth it. Tea was quite bland and food was totally bad. Service was so so only. Will not ever visit them again

We went to Marina Bay TWG on our recent visit to Singapore. TWG is always pack with people when we walked pass. We thought we will give it a try. We ordered a wagu steak and a chic set that consist club sandwich and a pastry.The wagu steak was ok. I reckon we could have a really nice piece of steak with that price. The chic was horrible in my opinion. The sandwich taste like a stake of stale sandwiches that has been toasted and rested in the open air for hours. The pastry we had is their house specialty. I am a sweet lover and the pastry really disappoint me. Just pure sugar without any fragrant.They do serve fine tea. That is the only plus

It's seems like the food served in TWG differs from brunch to brunch. The smoked salmon eggs benedict and seafood lasagna we had in Takashimaya was really really good. The tea was good of course although pricey. However the staff are not very efficient. They gather near the counter to chit chat and not walk around to see if any diners would need something. We had to call them a few times before we could catch any attention.But overall nice experience

I have to admit the tea was fine. The service was just ok....until I chased out of the restaurant on my way out. The bill had been presented at my table. Came to about SGD 12.50 and I left SGD 15.00. As I am exiting the cafe i have staff running after me asking why I didn't pay the bill. Staff and clientele of TWG and customers of Takashimaya all staring at me. I told them I had left all the money on the table and they said they hadn't checked yet.....wouldn't you check? Really? I will N E V E R return. It was hideous

Went for afternoon lunch at the Marina Bay Sands branch overlooking the "river". As it was my first time sitting in at the restaurant, needless to say i had high expectations of both service and food. After being seated for almost 10 mins, nobody came to take our order NOR serve us bread although we were starving, despite it not being busy. We had to desperately flag a waiter because all the staff were being unattentive. Then, after our orders were taken, i got served a tea that was NOT of my expectation. I even consulted the waiter of what i wanted, which was simple vanilla infused tea- i got served a floral tea which tasted like water. I had to wait another 10 mins to get the attention of another staff to get it changed. Horrible aptitude and lack of knowledge about the flagship product, plus might i add all the staff do not speak very good english, as they are either from phillipines or china!The part i am most angry about is this. I went to the parlour to purchase their ice cream, and i was told by the staff that one customer was only allowed to try ONE flavour each. After i paid, i then asked again if i could try another one, and was still refused! I am a paying customer, and i have never experienced this kind of stupid policy at any ice cream places, let alone an upscale one. After walking off, i then noticed a bunch of staff at a corner taking a break and slacking off. It is no wonder why the service was so poor as all the FTs are busy taking breaks and not working! Will NOT go back again as there are restaurants who better deserve my money. Looks like cash can't even buy proper service nowadays

My partner and I went to the TWG in marina bay shoppes. I had the burger and she had a lasagne. Fine dining at its best. I sipped on the singapore English breakfast. It was so yummy. Never seen a tea shop quite like this before. We had a lovely time looking through the pages of all the teas they had available. After all the choices we had avaiable we finally picked one. Tea is served in there finest tea pots which you can also buy from the TWG store. If your anyone near a TWG, it is a must!!

It is not easy to find a quiet place for lunch at Raffles Place. TWG @ Republic Plaza is nice respite for the hustle & bustle, almost a lunch spa. You pay for it, of course. Hotel-like prices but definitely offers more privacy than hotels. They offer set lunches (comes with a tea) here or you can order from the a la carte menu. You'd pay about S$18 to S$25 range for a salad but it is good quality salad. The food here is good quality cafe food and I love TWG. High quality tea on porcelain tea cup

I visited TWG at Marina Bay Sands (the one near LV) on Oct 28. Given that MBS is a tourist attraction, I will expect the service is to be good. However, it is a total opposite. The service is bad n all the staff face is black as charcoal like someone owe them millions of dollars. If there is 0 or negative rating I will definitely give them that. I will never ever go bk there anymore even the food is gd

You can try really 1000 of veritety of tea and also you can buy it. It's on Ion Mall in Scott road in 3 & 4 th level of this mall . Also they serve very tasty cakes and dessert . Very fancy and nice to try it

Had my first taste of TWG tea on Singapore Airlines and went to the store/restaurant to buy some for myself at home. Their vast tea selection pleases the eyes and nose. The tea is arranged on a large carousel where you can 'sample' (smell) the tea. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful to helping you narrow down your choices.Did have afternoon tea with a friend and service was excellent. Like most high tea service, it is not inexpensive, but worth a nice splurge. I have often wondered what to buy for friends when traveling back home to give them a taste of Singapore, and now I've found the perfect gift. Small bags of tea. Easy to pack and friends will love it

This is the TWG branch in Ion. A lunch size burger (not the ginormous American thing) with crispy fries. Service is fast and they even recommend a good tea to go with it (what's wrong with a good beer?)

I love SIngapore, it's probably one of my top five world cities. The TWG we went to was at Marina Bay a beautiful big and airy mall. I don't even drink tea but my wife does and this trio was her Birthday present so she got to choose. There is a main shop and just a few yards from it is a raised seating area which affords a great view. The place is decorated well with fresh flowers nice seating. The staff are super attentive and professional. My Wife loved her tea's (she had two different kinds). She loved her food. My food a wagyu burger and fries was amazing, so fresh, so moist and beautifully presented. I relaly nice place to spend some time relaxing

If you love tea, TWG has fabulous range of different teas. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable to recommend the type of tea that suits your palates. And the pastries are amazing! The scones, in my view, are the best, and a must have everytime I visit the place. Had a lovely time at Takashimaya TWG with the family just before departing

I had a lunch at TWG in Takashimaya.I thought TWG had a best scone in Singapore but not...The scones was like rocks...I think they gave me yesterday's left over...I asked them to change... very disappointed...Im not going to order scone. I need to find a good scone somewhere else

I love TWG tea. I have bought it in Singapore, Harrods and over the net.But sadly,the MBS TWG tea salon didn't meet expectations. My brunch set consisted included tea, juice salad, scones and a pastry. The tea was great - no surprises, except my tea cup hadn't been cleaned properly. The table next to mine had the same problem. Also, the gold plating / colouring on the teapot was rubbing off... Very tatty.... I had an aviator salad (their spin on a Caesar), which was fine, but then the staff started rushing me. I was still eating my salad when they were asking to bring out my scones. I asked them to please give me 5 mins. 1 minute later, one took my salad bowl and the other placed down my scones. They were fruit scones... I wasn't given the option of plain scones. The cream tasted funny and wasn't as cold as I would expect. Then, whilst I am still eating my scones, the asked me to leave the table to choose my pastry...WTF.... Leave me alone!!!I chose one, it arrived promptly and I ate it... Still with 1/3 pot of tea left, I' m trying to relax when the waiter plonked the bill down on the table.... When I left, I saw a line of people waiting for tables... I then understood why they were rushing me... Unacceptable. Ruined what might have otherwise been a reasonable brunch...I am probably most disappointed because of my fondness for TWG tea... TWG - train your staff!!!!

Visited the ION Orchard outlet to indulge in tea and dessert after dinner. TWG has paid great attention to detail, from the patina of the cutlery to the meticulously layered flavors of the crème brûlée. The chocolate fondant was also rich and flavorful without being too sweet.Service was just about adequate for a restaurant of its class - I was there on a slow night - but more importantly, the staff were knowledgeable about the wide variety of teas offered and were able to recommend something to go with the desserts

TWG has been in business for a long time in Singapore. All of us who had tea here at their outlets @ MBS are perplexed that other than the elegant decor, the whole place is letdown by :1) Poorly trained staff who had no idea of the 200 or so teas that they offer and what is the difference and the palate between each of them,2) The opera music in the background is so loud and irritating that it makes conversations difficult and worse of all,3) the food, the tarts, the scones etc, for a tea place, is horribly done. the tarts and scones were burnt at the bottom and lumpy inside4) they only had 1 jam, ie apricot jam. What kind of a tea place doesnt have strawberry jam to go with the scones etc,,,even a coffee shop has more than 1 kind of jam...In a nutshell, top dollar for a worse than Yakun offering,,,
2
We went to TWG at Marina Bay Sands and we were attracted by the beautiful decor of old world charm. That's where it ended...Although service was friendly, it was rather chaotic as we had to wait a long long time (20mins) before our tea came. I am sure most of us are accustomed to adding hot water to the pot of tea but alas we could not do so as it's TWG's practice to infuse the tea and throw the leaves out from the pot. All of us felt shortchanged.The tea snacks such as scones were far from good and we could not finish them.Will I go again? Perhaps but perhaps not. Actually most likely not, but the decor is really beautiful... For a great experience in the typical English afternoon tea, I think the whole experience is more authentic at Fullerton Hotel's club floor

Located in the hectic Ion mall in orchard road, The TWG tea house was a perfect oasis to relax from the hassle and bustle of Singapore shopping. With over 800 teas and a great old world atmosphere, this is a great spot for a break. I will be making this a regular spot when visiting Singapore

Had always love going to TWG for their wonderful selection of teas and desserts. However the latest visit on Christmas day to the outlet at Orchard Ion Level 1 really puts me off. We join the queue outside the restaurant for the next available seats and when it was our turn, the server attempt to seat the party behind us. When questioned, the server responded by saying the guest behind had registered with her and she need to seat them first. There is no sign to say guests are to register before joining the queue and I had even checked with her if there are available seats earlier and was told to join the queue with no mention of 'registering'. I refuse to let the party behind my group go first as I know for a fact that they come much later then my group and was behind us in the queue. The server then consulted with the manager and both came back to us explaining that as the group behind us had register thus they are to be seated first. This really irritates me, I asked the manager why bother having a queue system when guests are suppose to register with the server instead of queuing? In the end, my party was seated. To add salt to the wound, there was no apology from both the manager and this particular server. Later, when my friend signal to place our order, the manager (who talk to us earlier) who had seen her signal, turn to request another staff to serve us instead while the manager stand at the counter doing 'nothing'. This is really unacceptable. I was and still am very shock to experience such low level of service from a TWG outlet. I had been to other outlets on numerous occasions and it was always a happy occasion with great food, drinks and service. I am really puzzled why this particular outlet fall so short of the service standard. My advice to all, do go to TWG for their wonderful range of teas and desserts but avoid this particular outlet in order not to face their low level of service and bad attitude
