Good food.
Long queues.
Small space.
Around 20 SGD per person.
Worth a try.
Free flow soup servings.
Extra 10 cents for additional wet tissue.

I am here again for Song Fa Bak Kut Teh. I strongly recommended Song Fa Bak Kut Teh if you are looking for Bak Kut Teh as dinner or lunch in Singapore.
4
Overall very nice experience,staff was polite no problem with communication and the food was pretty good.Bak kut teh was one of better ones i've tried
4
Worth the wait .... Almost everyday during lunch or dinner there will be long Queue .
The pork ribs is juicy , succulent and tender. The side dishes look delicious too. The soup is free flow....
Service was normal...

I was taken here by colleagues in Singapore for a business lunch. This is a common Singaporean dish and they were interested in me trying it. I have to say it was edible, but quite an acquired taste. I went for the more expensive loin chop which I would recommend. The meal was accompanied by rice, Pork Belly and Pak Choi which was very nice and more in keeping with what I would eat. Worth a visit for the experience if you're a western business traveler like me
4
The main dish is the bowl of soup. The amount of flavour in the bowl is out of this world, some say its therapeutic some say its hot and junky.Meat was good in the soup, served with rice and a few interesting side dishes.Only down side are relatively expensive compared to other local restaurants
4
It's one of the most popular restaurants among the Chinese tourists. We arrived at the restaurant at 2PM, it was still full of customers. The most famous dish, Bak Kut Teh, namely pork ribs soup, is delicious, while the ribs are tender and succulent. Other food are also tasty. A perfect meal for a Chinese stomach
5
I never try Bak Kut Teh before but i got a suggest from my friend so I go and i have to say that i can have this everyday! spend only 4-5 days at Singapore but I go have lunch here for 2 days.When you order Bak Kut Teh Soup here you can re-fill it all the time with no limit this so awesome! and they also have sweet veggie, rice, iced tea that you should try too.so many people when lunch time have to wait in a long line but service pretty fast so don't worry about time. I got lucky that i met some Singapore guy who once travel to Thailand before and also being a Teacher so he recommend me and my friends so many tip at this restaurant and how to travel in Singapore. that why i'm impressive with food, people and this country
5
In my opinion this restaurant served the best bak kut teh in town. The soup is rich in taste (peppery) and the fish dish is also delicious. The price is fair. But this place is always packed with people during lunch and dinner. But it will worth the queue.
5
I'm from Thailand. We have Bak Kut Teh in Thailand but the taste is quite different. To me, I like Bak Kut Teh at Song Fa because the spicy from pepper and the sweetness of pork rib. Overall taste is delicious and outstanding. This one I put in the category of MUST try
4
Really simple and nice food. Th Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is nicer than its Malaysian counterpart. Less “herby” and more peppery.
The stewed pork hock is also worth trying.
4
Was very busy but service was fast and efficient. Not a lot of choice on menu but enough for a quick bite. Braised pork belly was lovely. Cheap and cheerful.
5
Omg, I tried few Bak Kit Teh in Singapore, and this is definitely the most of the most, the meat was soft and soup was tasty with black pepper favours. Not expensive at all.
Free refill of soup, eat those meats with chilli soy sauce.
5
If you haven't discovered the delights of pork bones boiled in a fantastic peppery broth.. you need to try Song Fa... you won't be alone!.. there will be people queueing inside and outside ( tip .. go inside the mall and queue there, the line will be shorter. I had the large pork bone stew and shared a large bowl of the Chinese donuts to soak up the broth.. and servers with large kettles will top up your bowl when needed!I have had Malaysian Bak Kut Teh (BKT) which is a slightly more herbal infusion than that of more spicy and peppery Singaporean edition.. Both are great though Songa Fa serves the peppery version which was apparently originally enjoyed buy Chinese labourers, originating maybe from Fujian, China. There is not a huge menu for fussy eaters so park them a McDonalds next door or give them some white rice and greens to enjo

I eat Asian cuisine weekly but have never had this particular combination of dishes outside of southern China. These types of restaurants have a very limited menu and, similar to a French steak and frites bistro, try to do those few dishes well. And in my opinion this one succeeds.The star is a pork rib soup that comes with generous meat on the bone and a peppery (but not spicy) broth. The effect is a cross between consommé and Moroccan Snail Soup (which is excellent by the way). Other dishes on offer include slow roasted pork belly, pig’s trotters, or intestines. If this seems too exotic, trust me the taste and texture of the first two are largely similar and delicious and the third is quite good also. They also have veggie choices and rice as well as some starters and side dishes. Soup ladies walk around topping up your broth should you wish.Lunch for two was $40 including tax and service and we went for the premium options and some extras. Very satisfying meal. Very clean and efficient. And genuinely a worthy experience if you are new to this kind of Chinese cuisine variant and want to try one of the best in Singapore. Note, it does get busy but take that as a good sign given how many other places try to do something similar
4
You get to place your order first while queueing and what I like about this place is once you get assigned to your seats, the food will be served to you within just a few minutes. This is what I called efficiency. Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is still one of the best in SG and very popular amongst locals too. Do order their crunchy fried dough fritter and also their braised pig's trotters. Definitely will head back there again for dinner
5
Well, I’ve never eaten feet and insides before, so this was a bit outside my comfort zone. Unless you know what you are doing, stick with the ribs! Line was a mile long, so it must be the real thing. They were nice to us, even though we didn’t have a clue what we got ourselves into
4
Came here once before and already loved it. Thought I should write a review to how I love this restaurant!If you are new here, order the classic Bak Kut Teh, it is the traditional way of eating this. The pork on the bone is nice and tender, but if you want better pork go for the loin meat Bak Kut Teh(the normal loin, not the premium one. Why? I cannot sense the difference and it is also more expensive). You can get unlimited extra soup if you order any of the Bak Kut Teh too! Just remember to tell the service staff when he/she comes by.On ordering side dishes, ordering the Tofu is up to you. But, please try the Peanuts and the Salted Vegetable, even if you don’t like vegetables. I can 100% guarantee you that you will love either one! If you are coming back again after ordering the Salted Veg, I suggest you order a medium portion as once you start, you almost cannot stop! I also love the fact that this restaurant has got the hot water taps next to your table so you can Top up your tea yourself! Why I only give this restaurant a 4/5 and not 5/5 is because the soup sometimes, although most of the time is MUCH LESS peppery than those across the island, it may not be consistent. If this is fixed, I will come back much more often! Nevertheless, very nice place with good ambience, food and service
5
Reviewed this restaurant over a year ago. Been to there other branches and just happen to pass by today, so had to have Song Fa again. It never disappoints, service is good unless you don't understand that sometimes they are packed. The place is still as clean as before. Song Fa never disappoints, which ever branch we visit
4
Mid morning brunch With a business friend old town. Popular restaurant is always full and need to wait in a queue to get in. The soup is great. Chicken feet plus fish dish were great while the most popular items are internal organs Friendly service and value for money
5
Title says it all. I had dinner there and it was super delicious. Quick service and reasonably priced.
4
Dropped in for a bite to eat. Very casual authentic Bak Kut Teh. The food was excellent, the service super efficient. We sat down had a meal and left satisfied. Recommend this place for a very authentic home style traditional meal.
5
When you visited Singapore don't miss "buk kut teh" . There are many branches. At Chinatown is one of famous. Long queue because delicious.
1
I have been eating bakuteh since I was young..... this one???? Isn't bakuteh!!!!! This owner you are Damaging the reputation name of bakuteh!!!! Just visit to Malaysia klang any stalls learn your cooking skill ! Jesus Christ!
3
No doubt the bak kut teh is good (though not exceptional) and even at 1.30pm on a weekday, we had to queue for a table. However, the service is as bad as the food is good, the guy at the door won’t greet or even say a word, will show irritation if you ask questions and it’s hard to get a smile or acknowledgement from anyone in the restaurant. The toilet also has no mean of drying your hands and if you ask for tissue paper, they’ll happily sell you some. But apparently this restaurant is listed on the Michelin guide..
4
i love Bak Kut Teh in Malaysia, this is a bit different as Malaysia is herbal taste and this is Singapore id white peper taste, but is nice. don't expect good service or comfortable sitting as people waiting outside the restaurant for 30 minutes to get a chair to sit down worth to wai
4
I'm Malaysian and had many Bak Kut Teh before but trying out Singapore's style of Bak Kut Teh is definitely something refreshing especially the broth is totally different compared to Malaysia's.Song Fa Bak Kut Teh's soup based comes with more of white pepper & pork intestinal while Malaysia's one is thicker, herbal soup.The tea at Song Fa is very good, try it while having meal
4
People usually comes here for the Pork Ba Kut Teh. Personally I like other foods other than the Pork Ba Kut Teh. Busy place as this venue opening 2 welcoming entry from either side. The fish soup, chicken feet with tofu skin, shrimp spring rolls or Ngo Hiang and salted vegetables are really delicious and light. Service very good and soup broth always being topped up whenever needed without any charge. Reasonable price too.
5
Me and my friends were finding a place to have dinner, and I mean any place! But we got lucky we were in front of Song Fa Bak Kut Teh and we had no idea this is the most famous Bak Kut Teh restaurant in Singapore. Food was great especially unlimited soup and also service. Reasonable price in the most expensive town in South East Asia
5
Long queue to get a seat but staff were friendly and food was served quickly after we were seated. Pork ribs were tender and the soup was really nice. Before we finished our soup, a staff will come over to refill our bowl. It is definitely a great place for tourist to try Singapore bak kut teh and the price is very reasonable too!
4
The unlimited serving of Bak kut teh soup @ Song Fa Restaurant China town is an attractive idea, the soup is tasty, we like the salty vegetables as well
4
If you're craving for some clear-peppery-soup bak kut teh, Song Fa is a good choice. They serves Singapore's style bak kut teh. If you come during lunch or dinner time, please be prepare for the queue. But it's definitely worth the wait.
5
One of the best bak kut the, good environment.staff little bit impatient. But tast good . Big dish. Worth it.
4
First dinner I had with my family this year in this restaurant. Every time I visit Singapore I always make sure that I get to have a taste of Songfa's Bak kut teh. I love how rich the soup is.You can really savor the spices and slow cooked beef ribs. I've been to a lot of restaurants that offer the same dish but this place have the best. I can't give a perfect score in this review because the staff were somehow not that attentive. I speak mandarin and Cantonese but I prefer English and they can't even communicate properly with it which kind of odd because it is a very diverse country. I got tired trying to catch their attention or low key shout just to have additional orders.
4
The rib soup was good, not very strong in pepper flavor (I personally prefer stronger). The vegi in soup was very good too. The only thing that makes me not give a 5 star rating is because the rib was rather hard and not tasty, so I'd rather not spend extra to order rub soup, but just order normal pork soup
3
We thoroughly enjoyed our simple serve of the pork rib soup but are now disappointed reading the reviews. Obviously as a Caucasian we don't deserve or receive all of the information and top ups if the soup. We have noticed a trend here that discriminates strongly against Westerners. Very disappointing as westerners hugely contribute to the 16 Billion dollars spent as a tourist in this country. Prices are exorbitant everywhere! You don't mind paying but you expect the same service and information. Be warned
3
I tried their normal bak kut teh and the braised pork trotters/intestines combination. I do not mind their bak kut teh but I was terribly disappointed with the pork trotters/intestines combination. The pork trotters portion only had skin and fats with no meat to talk about. It was a total disappointment. The intestines wasnt too bad.What I love about this store is the service. An elderly uncle was there to keep re-filling the soup. This is the only reason I may come back here again.
4
I went to this restaurant right after entering Singapore. The food was good, but not stunning, maybe not exactly what I expect. Service was quick and no need to wait at the time I came here luckily. It was a good try of cuisine in Singapore though
5
The queue was long but it moved quickly. The staff got our order on ipad when we were in the queue so we hardly had to wait once we got our table. Each dish was good (ordered the bak kut teh, pigs trotters, veg and fried you tiao). Staff refilled our soup bowls at regular intervals without us having to call for them. Enjoyed the meal & will come again
5
Recommended by our hotel, this was the surprise stand out of our food in Singapore. Loin rib soup was absolutely fantastic. Good service, great price. Highly recommended. Word of warning: If you don't eat pork don't go there - there are absolutely no non-pork options. But the pork really is good :
3
I was attracted by the crowd patronising this eatery, only to find the quality average.
I ordered a SDG9 bak ku teh. But the meat was not all tender as highlighted by the waiter.
4
Port rib soup is sgd7 and it's relatively affordable in sg. Tastes like Korean galbitang with garlic.
I visited at 11am. Don't need to wait.
5
I like better than MY style.
This is very delicious with pepper.
But you don't drink alcohol here.
I wish I drunk a beer...
5
Song Fa will always have the queue but it is so worth it all the time. Their bak kut (pork ribs) are so tender and very tasty and the soup is so good! I had 3 refills... Yes, you can request for refills of soup. Furthermore, their service is really fast and very systematic. This restaurant is highly recommemded!
4
You really only come for the pork rib soup - the comfort soup can be really addictive. The pork rib was fine. They refill your soup readily and if you see a lull in that it's possibly they are preparing a fresh lot. The service was good considering the restaurant was well packed at dinner time.Things that fell below expectation:1) rice - not even average and could not finish.2) Chilli (sauce) - too watery and not my type. Luckily the cut chilli with dark sauce is what one eats for the pork rib soup so I could ignore that.3) Vegetable - mostly stalks4) pickled vegetable - fail5) tea - cup not washed! A lipstick stain was clearly visible. How could they?6) seating - be prepared to share tables, which are not very big to begin with.I'm giving 4 stars since I can see myself visiting for the pork rib soup again but I'll be wiser - I will skip EVERYTHING else
4
The restaurant is well managed and service is general smooth and efficient.Ordered the premium pork rib soup; pork leg and intestine. The soup was tasty and was topped up readily by the waitresses. However, I find the pork not quite tender for premium ribs.The pork leg and intestine were well cooked and tasty
4
Since I have come to Singapore. This has been my favorite place to eat bak kut Teh.. I originally found randomly this place when I was at Clark Quay (the 1st branch) and since then I have always brought all my friends and family to try this restaurant. Since this branch has opened in chinatown I have felt this place more comfortable. The waiting Line is inside the mall so you won't suffer of the hot weather. The waiting time is not too bad all the time I have visited this place. All my overseas friend and family liked this place I really recommend it.
5
Walking past towards China Town we saw the place chockablock full and people queuing so we thought we better find out what's the fuss about. They give you the menu while queuing and also take your order so once you're seated the food arrives in matter of seconds, pretty clever I have to say. We ordered two soups, braised pork ribs, porkbelly and some green leafy veg. All pork cooked to melting consistency, the pork broth (constantly refilled and piping hot) probably one of the 10 best things we have ever tasted. Mind you, my partner is a chef so this is a bold statement. Outstanding experience!
4
The food is delicious, recommending their Bak Kut Teh! The meat is tender and the soup is nice! Staff refills the soup for you so you can drink as much as you like. They take your order while queuing and deliver your food soon after you sit down.However, the place is a bit small so it may not be very comfy to sit
4
Malaysia will swear kelang bak kut teh is the best ! This is the truth The spore version is the teo chew style ie peppery or pork soup with white pepper flavour.Verdict - not bad with chunky ribs and bottomless soup ! We don t have this type in KL/pJ as there is no good enough to replace medicinal/herbal BKTThis place gets my thumbs up, BKT teochew style 
4
I love the strong peppery taste of the Bak Kut Teh. Chunky rib with delicious meat that's satisfying and fulfilling. They also refill the soup so I am happy.
5
This was some of the best food we had in Singapore! The pork ribs soup, in all it's simplicity is amazing!
5
The food here is very delicious and tasty. It is one of the eatery that you must go to when in Singapore. The Pork Rib Soup is really nice being soft and tender and flavorful. Service here is very fast.
4
Interesting taste and flavor. Mid range budget. They will keep pouring soup into the bowl until your done. The queue is long but it moves pretty fast. Worth it if you like pork.
3
For me I m not a big friend for bak kut teh But please can serve the soup is hot soup not a warm soup ? And the pork ribs not really tender and rubbery. I think may be I m not really understanding singapore foo
5
Went to the 1 at Chinatown Point Mall which is just located beside Mac Donald at level 1. Nearest station is Chinatown (Purple / Blue Line). This place is always full house on Lunch and Dinner time. The best is to go early. Waiting time can range from 10 - 30 mins during these 2 periods.Food is nice and there are free re-fill of soup. Price are reasonable. Very popular and all tourists should try it out
5
It is different to the Bak Kut Teh I had in Hog Kong before, with less Chinese medicine ingredients. But I prefer this Bak Kut Teh more. It tastes so good and it is peppery. The staffs will come to you to refill the soup for free. Will definitely come back for sure.
4
There are different soup based for this local favorite dish "bak kut teh" (pork rib soup). The key favorites are herbal based or pepper based. This shop serves pepper based soup which I suspect have a mix of both white and black pepper. Spicy yet not overly spicy.Do try the premium pork loin if you cannot decide what to order. The dough fritters go well with the soup, just pick up a piece, dip it into the soup and pop it into your mouth. Delicious. Though I do wish the fritters were a bit more crispy, they are usually served soft and cold. The green vegetables are forgettable. Not a must but I will still order one small portion just to have a more balanced meal. The pig innards are a delicacy to Asians but I do avoid them for health reasons. Ask for soup refill as many times as you like so long as you can finish them to avoid wastage, they are very generous unlike other shops. Soup refills are free. This is one of the key reasons why I keep returning to eat. The food are fast to serve, the servers are prompt in addressing your requests, polite and smiley making it a pleasure to dine here. Comfort food during especially a rainy day.Do come early as the queue starts to form real fast and long after 11.45am.
4
The Bak Kut Teh (sic) or simply Pork Rib Soup is truly one of the best tasting Pork Rib Soup I had locally. Although some friends had opined that the soup and overall taste at New Bridge Road Main Branch fares better, however; on my visit to the Chinatown Point Branch located at the basement near the McDonalds; found the taste similar to the main branch. I found the staffs there rather polite as well. The added plus is that the food came lightning fast for my early dinner at 17:00 hours on a Saturday. I was glad I did not have to wait like 15-25 minutes or so with my previous experience at the main branch on a weekend :
5
You knpw you are in for a good feast when (1) you have tp line up; (2) all the locals are here; and (3) everyone has ordered the exact same dish. The taste was very peppery and not too herbally and delicious. Worth coming here. You are paying for the meat and soup is unlimited refills.
5
One of the must go places for Tourists as well. The peppery pork ribs soup is one of the best in Singapore and do order the other sides dishes like vegetables, pork belly etc. Tasty!
5
We went there twice during our 6days holiday in Singapore.. tried their new product: ngohiang. Everything was soo delicious! This is one of a must visit restaurant in Singapore
5
Excellent food and very affordable. Loved the pork with rice on the side. Very tasty and highly recommended.
5
Do yourself a favor and get over to Song FA Bak Kut Teh, either at its Chinatown Point location or any of the others located in Singapore. You're in for a treat. They specialize in Bak Kut Teh, simple short ribs in a clear and surprisingly peppery brother. During my visit I tried the regular short ribs and the "premium" short ribs version. I found the regular version way better. The "premium" kind has very lean short ribs, which may be great for someone not looking for the satisfyingly fatty experience that the regular version features. But, I wanted fat! So the regular version was the winner in my book. Price is reasonable, around $8 a person for the regular bak kut teh
5
Had lunch here. They have the air conditioned and non air conditioned options. We went for the air conditioned option. The soup is delicious and come with unlimited refill of soup. There 4 of us and total cost for 4 bowls of pork rib (including 1 premium pork loin) plus rice and side dishes cost around SGD56/- which is pretty reasonably priced.
3
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is a chain store, so you may come across them in different locations in Singapore. The one I went to was located at Chinatown Point which one can easily accessed by MRT - Chinatown station with an exit directly to Chinatown Point Centre.The Song Fa bak kut teh is the so-called "white" bah kut teh (pork ribs soup), which is much peppery taste. It is very different to the traditional Malaysian style "black" one which is herbal taste. One needs to look very hard to find a black one in Singapore. Seems like Singaporeans love the peppery taste more than the herbal taste.We ordered the standard bah kut teh and the special premium one which is S$3 more expensive. I liked the normal one better as it is less fatty. The refill of soup is free and the place is very clean and pleasant. I also tried their new dish - prawn rolls (minced prawn wrapped in bean curd sheets), it was a bit dry and blank.If you haven't tried the white bah kut teh, you should at least try once. However highly recommend that you look for the black one before you decide which one you like best
5
I had many Bak Kut Teh in my trip in Singapore, this was by far the most delicious. The meat was, of course, juicy and tender but the broth is amazing. And free refills too - win!Fast friendly service. It was soo good I had to go back a second time and bought some of the tea bags to try to make it myself at home
5
We had the rib soup the prawn special and some more pork . It was a new taste for us . The pepper in the soup was different but delicious and they keep refilling which was awesome :) service was fast also. And the couple that sat next to us gave us a history lesson about the soup... apparently it was like that to give workers an appetite during long hard days of work .... according to that guy :) try it if your around :
3
I love pork ribs soup and I love this version in Singapore. The salted veg was fantastic-salty and braised beautifully. The braised peanuts were ok; Mum had the bean curd skin and the braised chicken feet and she liked those. My complaint would be about the pork ribs served. I ordered the premium pork ribs (S$12) which is $2 more expensive then the usual pork ribs soup. Although large in size, it was ridiculously tough and impossible to eat. I had to ask for a plate, and used both hands and the use of chopsticks to pry the meat off the bone. Sadly, my only qualm would be the texture of the pork rib, as the service was prompt, efficient and quick, and the food was generally tasty.
4
This is a very famous restaurant in the heart of Singapore best known for the Bak Kut (meaty rib bone) soup and many items of pork. The restaurant is not very big, and although there are two together, they are always crowded. Food prices are not cheap, but an unlimited free refill of the soup itself is provided. The soup is pretty peppery and the herbal taste is not significant which is actually many local consumers' preference.
3
Very different from Malaysian bak kut teh, its very peppery, not served in hot pot and less herbal profile. Again taste also very personal.
Portion is good for the price and not stingy in refill soup. Worth a try
5
The restaurant is quite small but very cozy. 2-4 people is suitable. Ordered ribs soup and some dish I can't remember the name. They taste good. Recommended!
4
never disapointed for the best bak kut teh in town. just the queue is a testimonial to the popularity of this place, but it is well managed and not too long to wait .
Great taste. .
4
I've tried several bak kut teh joints, and this chain for me is the best.
The service is quick and they always make sure your soup is refilled.
On top of that, you can buy bak kut teh sachets and try cooking it at home.
5
For authentic bak kut teh this is the place to be.nice ambience.cordial staffs.decent seating arrangements
4
'Bak Kut' was really tasty, meaty and delicious. The soup was also pepperish and saltish. They have other side dishes like livers and pig blood which are my favourite.They have 2 shops around the corner: air-conditioned and non-conditioned.However, the crowd is quite heavy at times and you need to wait for almost 30 minutes to get seats
5
We like the pig stomach soup and braised intestines besides the pork rib soup. The pig stomach is cooked just right and you get a large serving. We don't cook pig stomach soup at home anymore, if we feel like eating this we go to Song Fa. The soup here is the Teochew style, no black soya sauce in it, and you can have refills
5
Incredibly delicious! And they keep topping up the soup as mush as you want! The herbs was so well balance and not overpowering (which is good for the likes of my dad who does not like the taste or the smell). They over a 'bag cover' to protect it from the splash .. in case you enjoy it too much..
4
Really enjoyed our dinner out with the kids. Everything was good, especially the pig trotters. The soup refills were especially appreciated and they even brought a covering cloth to protect my handbag from spills -how sweet is that ? Ps. Don't miss the homemade honey lemon drink
5
The restaurant's specialties - bak kut teh, broth, cooked from pork ribs, kidneys, liver or tail (on request) with pepper and herbs: What - the secret of the cooks. Bouillon invigorates and energizes the forces so that he was in the restaurant are lined with seven in the morning
4
Bak Kut Teh Pork Rib is excellent together with Bak Kut Teh Pork Fillet. You can have extra pepper. The lime juice is a good combination with the meal
4
Really nice food, nothing fancy but the food alone speaks for itself. Not just the Bak Kut Teh, but other dishes too.
Worth a visit.
4
I love this restaurant! The Bak Kut Teh is good. The fIavor is just right! They also refill the soup for free. I just don't like their drinks.
5
Reasonably priced and tasty foods, with a great variety of dishes to choose from. The famous "pork bone tea" is basically the signature dish every customer must have! Very cheap eats but yummy food for tourists who wants to try authentic Singaporean food!
5
Had brunch. Great food. No complaints, food or staff service. Reasonable price as well. Neat and airconditioned. As such not too sweaty after soupy food...
5
Great bak kuh teh for a good price. We highly recommend this as part of your SG itinerary. Great way to experience the culture. Good eats. There can be quite a long queue. We went at 11-ish and didn't have to wait. At 12, the long line appeared.
5
One of the few stores that offer authentic pork rib soup. Staff will keep refilling your bowl with bak kut soup until all the ribs are finished. They have a few stores & we visited the one in China town. Try to go early to avoid the long queue.
4
Ordered the Pork Rib and Pig Stomach Bak Kut Teh Soup, Braised Chicken Feet with Beancurd sheets, Choi Sum, and their homemade Water Chestnut Water. Pork Rib soup was very peppery but delicious too, if you want more soup, you can ask them to add more to your bowl at no additional charges. Braised chicken feet and beancurd was tasty too. No wonder at 9pm, the restaurant was still packed with people.
5
Always visit here for lunch or dinner as I enjoy the food and also the prompt service. Staff are helpful(helping you with orders and topping up with soup), the waiting time is short for the food to be serve but of course if it's during their peak periods, you'll need to queue quite some time before getting a seat. Enjoy your meal at Songfa as I do.

Price: AverageTaste: GoodService: AverageAtmosphere: Average but the a/c was a great help(Personal opinion. If anyone don't agree and insist its the 'Best', 'Bestest' in the world, good for you)The wait is fine (10 minutes or so). Service is ok but the way the queue is handled, lots of improvement required.Food wise, its just so-so. The soup is no doubt good but somehow, we got extremely thirsty after the meal.No harm trying but to label it as excellent, I can only say its on par with the BKT at Hougang Avenue 8 (Song Fa used to be good but it appears the quality have somehow dropped).What I would suggest or recommend is if you are in a group, you might want to consider ordering different dishes and share (you can ask for an extra bowl/s and they are ok with it) so that you get a variety. Place a second order if a particular dish suits your taste.If one is looking for BKT with Spices and not peppery BKT, this is not the place.Happy sweating, I mean, eating
5
This is one of my favorite restaurant.
The soup is rich and clear.
The service is also kind and warm.
I personally like the lime juice!
3
Taste is neither bad nor fantastic! Ok lor! For the price I pay, I expect it to be better!
No special dishes to recommend! No need to keep going there to eat. Once in a long while to eat is enough....
4
It was a fairly good dining in the casual restautant for Bah Kut Teh. Song Fa is known as one of the best in Singapore although Singapore has a few better one in my personal point of view.
4
Peppery clear soup broth with pork ribs and the staff comes by to refill your bowl with even more tasty soup! Yes, free refills!
Be careful, they charge you for the hand wet-nap cleaners 😠
2
We searched this place out via trip advisor Because of its strong reviews BUTR when we go there we looked at the location ... right next to McDonalds and waited in line for 15 minutes all the time looking inside ... we finally decided it wasn't worth waiting any more
5
If you are looking for the best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore this is the one.They serve very tender pork rib soup in a great environment. The soup is very tasty and they can be topped up for free. Also try the peanut, fried fritters, pork leg and vegetables.

Song Fa is definitely my favourite bakuteh in town - rich pepper and pork broth, with tender meat that falls of the bone. Eat them with the dark soy sauce and a side of peanuts, salted vegetables and fried dough fritters for the soup. Do remember to add more soup to enjoy the dish to the fullest

We like to eat soupy stuffs during rainy season and a healthier choice is to pick sliced fish from Song Fa!They have a new menu item called prawn ngoh hiong which is tasty. For drinks, i've always ordered water chestnuts. One thing to be aware though is that they charge the tissue 20cents per pcs, for your info. Soup refill is unlimited.
5
Every time I come to Singapore, I will come to Song Fa to have Bak Kut Teh once. I really like the taste and the soup is free refill !! Lunch hour, please expect long queue. As a tourist, I tend to go during off hour time like 2pm or so! Less people then ! happy eating !
4
Staff were prompt to orders and were very considerate,offering serviettes and cloth to protect our bags in case the soup spills onto our bag.Also, a small rubbish bin was placed for us to put our food waste.Food was served warm and instantly.It tasted great and portion was just right!:) A wide variety of drinks and ambience fits the oriental culture and menu served in terms of decoration and interior. A pleasant visit! Will visit again
4
The food is ok, relatively nice and given that the bak kut is considerably fresh. Soup is peppery but not too spicy so still ok. A good place for family and friends gathering.
5
good for any time
I used come here for breakfast and lunch!!
you mush visit here when you visit singapore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The soup taste was tasty. The pork rib is tender not very hard. The price was suitable for the enviroment they provide.

Living up to his name as the authentic BKT.
The soup is simply delicious and you can't resist to ask them to TOP up for more!
The meat is very tender and have the Qq taste..
5
you can walking to SongFa Bak Kut Teh from Parkroyal on Pickering or from Furama Hotel. There are alot of foods there and we ordered popular dish. Reasonable price for good taste. Recommence!

good food but place seems crooked, not unusual in third world countries. make sure you check your bill and your change

This restaurant had raving reviews and so here I am! Nothing like first hand reviews to get me try a new place especially since we were all in a mood for good soup! Song Fa Bak Kut Teh, is a small and none pretentious place whose purpose is to serve you their delicious offerings. We had the Premium Loin Rib Soup, Braised Trotters With Intestines, Kai Lan Vegetables, and noodles. What a feast that was and yes, the soup is endless. They continue to come by and add more soup to your bowl when they see it disappearing! The soup is unbelievably the most delicious soup I'v EVER had!!!!!! The restaurant name literally translate to meat bone tea
5
Don't be put off by a line out front- it moves quickly. The staff were great- we ordered while waiting then upon sitting down our food was quickly served (good for all). The gailan (jialan) was very nice but the place is most famous for it bak kut teh (ribs in tea soup) which are also delicious. Perhaps our favourite dish, though, was the pork belly. And the drinks were great- an ice lemon tea and lime juice.Service couldn't have been friendlier. And our 1-year old ate so much- many in the restaurant were impressed

Hello Aunties! Sharing with you our table at SONG FA Bak Kut Teh at Chinatown Point Singapore. From a humble pushcart stall in 1969 to seven restaurants all over Singapore, Song Fa made its legacy as the original Bak Kut Teh in town. "Bak Kut Teh which literally means meat bone tea is a soup brewed with pork ribs complete with various herbs and spices." I admit it hit me by surprise. It is the best clear soup experience I ever had! Oh and you want more? They give you unlimited soup to your heart's content!

SONG FA Bak Kut Teh is a busy restaurant. We need to wait in line for almost 30 minutes before we’re seated. Price is reasonable. Aside from its famous bak kut soup, we also ordered braised pig’s trotter and intestines. The soup is refillable with no extra charge. So, this is a plus point for SONG FA
5
My memory about BKT comes from the instant noodles I had consumed before. That night at SF changes what I know totally. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Refilling boat by boat as you wish.
4
I think the best thing about bak kut teh is the soup and I'm glad Songfa is very generous with its soup.
4
Quite nice bak kut teh at reasonable prices. If you like pepper bak kut teh, be sure to try this place for its tasty soup.
4
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is a must try place every time my family and friends visit me in Singapore. During my last visit, I learnt that now they use thicker pork ribs instead of pork lions in the premium soup. I really want to try the premium soup on my next visit
4
Had 5 of us at dinner, did not have to wait but it was busy on a weekday evening. We had been lucky. Food was good, had a range of different stuff - the ribs, innards etc. Free top-up of the soup. Service was good enough for the busy place. Note that it is quite an informal place. Also, there are two branches, one with air-con and one without; all along the same row of shophouses
5
There is always a queue in front of Song Fa, and it is because it is an excellent restaurant!! The food is great, borderline sinful!The restau itself is lowkey and charming!The queue may be daunting at first but it went quite fast when i decided to go and it was very much worth the wait!!Prices are reasonable (one basic "soup" is around 9 SGD, but you will and should be tempted to add a few extras!!!)Will definitely go bac

Fast service with good meat and the soup you can ask without paying extra, additional extra money. Feel the difference with other Song Fa Bak Kut Teh branches, such as in Jakarta.However the portion is too big for old people, therefore I advise to order one portion first, and then if you feel that you can eat and finish the portion, you can order one person for one portion, unless you cannot finish, you can share with someone who comes with you.Another important one, the restaurant give free additional soup, meaning you can and allow to ask more soup of Song Fa Bak Kut Teh for fre

Loved the peppery soup base that was used for all the soup items.Besides their signature pork rib soup, you can also order liver, kidney and intestines in your soup. The pork ribs soup (bak kut teh) was very satisfying and value for money- 3 large meaty pieces for each $7 bowl. The meat was lean yet tender and the piping hot soup was topped up very regularly, without us prompting. The kidney was properly cleaned without any smell but the liver was just so-so - eat them quickly or they will toughen if left in the hot soup for too long. My dad loved the stewed trotters which also had sufficient tender lean meat to satisfy non fat lovers.Chicken feet and tau kee (beancurd skin) was just average. The tau kee was too oily and a tad tough.The salted vegetables were pretty good with rice but again too oily.The yau char kuai (deep fried dough sticks) were soft n didn't taste too fresh. They are meant to be eaten after being soaked in the soup but I would have preferred them crispy.With bak kut teh, there are some accompaniments that are necessary to complete the experience. To me, the steamed rice, dark soya sauce and fresh cut chilli are essentials.The rice was a total let down. Didn't taste like good quality rice n was too soft. It would have been perfect if they had used good quality jasmine rice, cooked to a firmer consistency. The dark soy sauce was good - rich, slightly sweet and not too salty. Mixed with the fresh cut chilli, it improved the taste of the rice. Would I return? Yes ! For the heartwarming soup. But please please improve the rice
4
Dined here for the renowned 肉骨茶 and some fish soup for our late tea/ early dinner. The 肉骨茶 was peppery spicy, which really tastes like Chiu Chow style peppery pork belly soup. The service was relatively nice, they treated us respectively and even helped us take a picture for our family. The ambience was very competent, not much people was dining at the restaurant at that time. The value was relatively cheap and reasonable.
4
When we got here, it was busy. We had to stand outside until there was room inside the tiny building. They took our order outside though. So once we got inside, the food was practically brought straight out. Pork ribs were "fall off the bone" and very tasty. The soup was good, as well as "All You Can Drink".I only wish I received more ribs for the price
5
If you want to get a glimpse of Singapore, you should visit the place and try their soup. I myself love the pork rib soup and rice. I normally don't finish eating the whole thing but I did it this time. Irrisistible!!!!!
5
serves soup with various pig organs. the soup serves hot! and also refillable!
I tried lean meat soup, tried pig stomach, tried various the green leafy vegetables, groundnuts, dough fritters (a must to order!!), beancurd skin & braised pig intestines.
5
Just stay for 4 days in Singapore but i try here 3 breakfast! It open at 10 a.m. The staffs here very friendly. Especial they refill the soup in bak kut teh during your meal. Good food, nice service, acceptable prices.
4
This place was busy and full of locals when we got there. Queued for about 10 minutes, but you can place your order in the queue and it was ready when we sat down. Soup was nice, ribs fell off the bone due to being boiled. We had the braised pork belly and a vegetable dish which were also nice. You can get the soup refilled.
3
If you're up for either lunch - late dinner and want something to heat your stomach, This is the place you can go for. Several times went here I always eat the lean meat pork. Every store has the same standardize taste. It was a pleasant simple dish although, it was too much pepper taste for me.Overall nice if you want to eat something simple
4
Bak Kut Teh was so yummy, came with 2 long big rib of pork. Soup was great and free for fill up. Really enjoyed this meal. Quite many people there, sometime have to wait in front of the restaurant for a long time. Come on the afternoon to avoid the crowd. So tasty food here
5
I arrived at the restaurant during a rainy evening, so it's good time for this kind of food. We can see long queue in front of the restaurant, but the serving is really quick so I did not have to wait so long. I ordered bak kut teh with rice and chicken feet with bean curd sheet as recommended. The restaurant is well organized, so I have food in 2 minutes. Nice soup, with soft pork ribs, you can smell the pepper and herb inside. I loved to put the rice inside the soup and ate with the ribs, chicken and bean curd sheet. It was one of the most delicious meal I had in Singapore. I must be here again once I have trip to Sinapore, for sure
5
Their spare ribs soup is to die for. Absolutely delicious ! So many people queueing all the time during lunch so I often go either before noon around 11am or around 2 pm to avoid the crowd . Very busy if you come around 12noon and be ready to stand for a while outside the door before you can get seated.Prices are so affordable that bringing your friends or visitors wouldn't hurt your pocket at all. Highly recommended to everyone
5
I don't know what kind of pork ribs and seasonings they use, but they taste really good. The spiciness of the pepper mixed with the strong garlic smell... Incredible taste. I ordered one of the Bak Kut Teh meal with the white rice and re-filled the soup for almost 6 times. It is THAT good
5
Bakut teh is always fond by pork lovers, multi generation recipee but withstand their quality through out ages.This resto runs by family, never runs out of queues, space were very tight but I'm not afraid of being wet.. Huge fans hanging on every corners, decoration still uses old schools, maybe it was just like that from their forefathers.Serves pork as main dish, fishes and vegies are available but not alot. Ribs and loins are best for both standard or premium one. Uses only salt, garlic, and pepper as spices.Service system were good, they part themselves into roles, greets & orders, spices & ketchups, cooks, deliveries, bills, and cleans. They communicate eachother without difficulties, they uses comms instead of yelling in traditional chinesse dialect, and tablets and mini portable printers instead of papers with unclear writings. I'm on 10m long queue, no more than 5 mins already being served with all our orders at the table.. Great job guys.
4
The Bak Kut Teh that doesn't disappoints. Love the soup & big portion of pork ribs. Their sliced fish in bak kut teh soup was awesome too!
5
Their bak kut teh always taste authentic each time we visit, just can't get enough of it. Goes really well with rice. The menu offered a good variety of yummy side dishes to go with the soup.
4
Introduced by a friend .The place is packed during the afternoon. Good ribs and soup, Overall worth the visit.
4
This place is an institution and highly recommended. The dishes are all fantastic, super tasty and very good value. Place is packed so try to get there early or prepare to wait a bit.
3
The bak kut teh here is actually good. Because the place is generally so busy eating here can be a very transactional affair - you come in, you order, food will be served promptly, you eat and you get out. I don't know about the hygiene levels though - some patrons actually leave the pork rib bones on the table itself! I don't know whether the cafe sanitises the tables after each custome
5
This place is very popular for its Bak Kut Teh. It has various grades of pork ribs to choose from. I suggest you go foot the best one as the price is only a few dollar difference. They will keep refilling your soup bases reef charge if you want. We also have the pig tail and is also very good. This place is terribly busy at all time and the line up is usually long. Prepare to wait for up to half an hour. Many locals come here too. They do sell the soup base in box of 10 packets where you can make it at home. They do not take reservation. It is located right across Clarke Quay MRT station. Follow exit E. It is just across the street
5
Song Fa has been in business since 1969 and when we arrive for a much on a busy Sat there was a queue for tables which is always a sign of good food in Singapore. A new twist is as you are waiting a hostess takes your order and when you actually get to your table your food order arrives immediately . The Pork Ribs soup is the signature dish and the ribs are meaty and the garlic/pepper soup delicious . We had rice and vegetables but if it is your first try of this dish you should try a serving of Fried Doughnut with your sou
5
Into the Singaporean culinary tradition that is bak kut teh. For initiates, it's boiled pork ribs served with a lovely peppered broth, made more substantial by rice and a (I think) very dark soy sauce. It'd be a brilliant dish in the middle of winter somewhere cold, and surprisingly great on another steamy Singapore day.The restaurant itself is nothing special in terms of decor or service, but it's obviously revered by locals who queue out the door at lunchtimes. Don't worry about the queue either - you order via ipad whilst queuing and by the time a table frees up, your ribs hit the table about 2 minutes later. Cheap, cheerful and tasty - and definitely local
4
Went for the famous Bah kuh teh. Ordered the premium one and also a dish of veggies.Was served the two and also one rice (SGD0.9) and one wet tissue (SGD0.2) in additional.The BKT was delicious! Pepper spicy soup (not hot but spicy) which is refilled once in a while (free), the meat was soft and tasty. Must try dish.The rice was nothing special, may be value of SGD0.3 cents not more than this.The veggies wasn't bad. Did not eat the fried garlic on top.When I went to pay I handed back the wet tissue and the guy did minus without say anything which was nice
5
Song Fa is one of the best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore, with 6 branches in Singapore. Expect very long queues at this Chinatown Point branch as there's alot of tourists from China during our visit there.There's one branch in Orchard Centrepoint if you are shopping around in Orchard Road. The soup is tasty but the pork ribs are not as tender to my liking. I prefer the meat to slide off the bone and melt in my mouth... For a stronger peppery taste bud, i would suggest the Bak Kut Teh in Tiong Bahru... Price is reasonable and there's a wide variety of side dishes and drinks to choose from the menu
4
One of must try food in Singapore. Line up at entrance, well organized system with pre order during waiting. Quality ribs in pepper soup, free refill soup. Spend 53 Singapore dollars for 3 person with drink and side dishes.
4
As expected, we need 5 minutes to get seated. The quality is the same with the other outlet! The waitresses are so friendly and fast moving! Must pay once the order has arrived!
3
Actually it is about taste, for Malaysian it taste different and something is missing or too much of some ingredient .. Packed with people and for me is just OK
4
I'm a big fan of Bak Kut Teh and we come here often. It gets quite busy so sometimes we need to lineup but staff are efficient. It's an affordable, delicious filling meal. Free refills on the peppery garlicky broth! Must try!
5
The food is good. Price very reasonable. And it's very famous at Singapore. Should try this when u visit Singapore.
5
One of the popular bak kut tech in Singapore. Should go and try, quite different from those I ate in Thailand. And ice barley drinking is so good.
4
I came here at 11:30am, it's still ok, but after 12 the seats quickly filled up. One reason to come here is to try the famous pork rib soup. Singapore's version is lighter in colour, but quite spicy because of the amount of pepper, very different to its cousin in Malaysia, both are delicious. Service is fast and efficient, mid price and very filling. If you are in China town, it's worth your while to come try it. Notice, this is not a place for fine-dining, but rather canteen-like, but you won't leave disappointed
4
The reason you go there is for the pork ribs in broth. They keep filling your bowl with the delicious broth.We tried different dishes between the four of us and one of the highlights were the braised chicken feet, let's call them nibbles ;)Reasonably priced
5
It seemed to be many poople's favourite. First we tried the one near New Bridge Road near Clarke Quay. There was a a group tour arriving so crowded. We had to queue but luckily not for long. Tried their pork ribs in savory broth to find both're delicious. We also tried the Braised Pork Belly & Salted vegetable we love them all.The next day we came back for more but in China Town Point. Also had to queue ..this one is more convenient, and right on top of Chinatown MRT. We tried their Pork Stomach Soup and Braised Pork intestine. We prefer Braised Pork Belly though. Service was fast in both location
3
Very popular and famous restaurant for bak kut teh with rich pepper flavour. You can ask the waiter to give you more soup when you finish your bowl. The meat is tender and goes very well with black soy sauce.In terms of service, the waiter forgot to give me the wet tissue (which is mandatorily charged to my bill), when I asked for one, he double-checked with his colleagues and made sure I did not ask for extra right in front of me
3
Were there for quick lunch before going to Merlion quick service very different style with Bak Kut Teh that i ever had but nice the noodle soup "Mee Sua" was very perfect tasty soup the thing that you must try in SG ^^
4
Bak Kut Teh was my childhood favourite food, up till now I still enjoy it very much. It's recommendable for family lunches.
5
Definitely a hot spot for me visited this place 4 times across to visits to Singapore, this place is always busy, the food is always good, the people are always nice, the service is always good
very enjoyable
4
very nice bak kut teh, solid, delicious, i like the pepper flavor, but don't find it much better than the ones that can be found at food center, they are just as nice.
4
This is a very good Chinese restaurant. The food here is tasty. The service is good The price similar to other ones. The ambiance is O K.
5
the bak kut teh is so extraordinary. u HAVE to go there when you are in SingaporeAt first my husband did not want to go since he feel awkward feel the bak kut with tea..However, once he tasted it,.. he likes it so much...So, please come for tasting this bak kut... this is the best in Singapore..
3
The Bak Kut Teh price is very reasonable in city area, the food is so so only but the soup make it up to it, to take note that this place is always over crowded with people, so if you have time just go for it
5
This no nonsense restaurant asks you to pay for your meal as soon as you are served at the table. You then ask for add-ons as you go along...paying as you order. Its not a place you can lol around. Just eat and move on...Loved the fish soup and enjoyed the braised pork as well. They top up the soup in your dish as you eat...at no extra charge. I found both soups particularly flavourful.They price that all dishes come at is very cheap...by Singapore standards. They deserve their success and the line of customers waiting to be served is quite understandable
4
This is always on my top 3 to go places for bak kut teh and as usual, it did not fail me :) Although there was a queue, but service was fast and efficient! We ordered quite a bit cos all 3 of us were starving. 1. Pork ribs soup x2 - we ordered large portions and the ribs were generous. Very soft and tender. 2. Pork Tenderloin - my favourite! Very very soft and tasty, it melts in my mouth. 3. Braised pork - my partner and our friend loved this dish. Boys being boys, always eating fatty meats! 4. Beancurd skin and salted vegs - No complains. 5. You tiao - this was good, tasty. Most of the times, this dish is not tasty as they are too soggy. We paid $60+ for 3 pax, but went back happily
5
One of the popular bak kut tech (肉骨茶) in Singapore. should go and try, quite different from those I ate in Hong Kong. I definitely like Song fa style more! Also had Chinese tea pu-erh which was served in a very traditional way with small teapot set.
4
Very tasty quick inexpensive option in the heart of Chinatown. Obviously others agree as restaurant packed with locals .
5
I love it. Try their signature bak kut teh with rice, preserved veggies, nuts, and if you're a pork lover (pork tails, intestine, liver)
3
Although the pork ribs are ok, the soup is terrible, full of msg.
After returning home, within 15mins. I had gulped down a 750ml bottle of water and still feel very thirsty.
Into my 2nd bottle of 750ml water now.
5
Excellent, but simple meals! I loved this place. The waitstaffs are very nice as well. Definitely will return.
3
Very very Long wait and extremely overpriced for pork ribs. I think the reputation has gotten so huge that they are overcharging. Many people still swear by it and are willing to wait. Personally I don't think pork ribs are worth it.
5
This sort of food isn't something I usually go for, but as the phrase goes, 'When in Rome...'. We picked it from trip adviser so expected it to be packed with tourists. Which it wasn't. The food doesn't look much but really packed in the flavour. I went from the ribs, my wife the pork belly. Quick service, great value and great taste. Can't ask for more
4
Bak Kut Teh is typical singapore food thad kind of soup with pork ribs. Soup is make of broth with various kind of herb spices. Song Fa is the best bak kut teh in town. Location is near Clarke Quay MRT. Room with air conditioning and quite clean. Ribs is tasty and soft, soup is quite delicious. I will be come back again to this reastaurant whenever i visit singapor
5
Our first taste of Bak Kut Teh, quite an amazing experience indeed.The atmosphere is like what I have not encountered before!!You should see the long lines of people waiting to be seated!!! If it is lunch time make sure you reach there by 12 noon or else plan for a 20 minute wait!!The entire concept is well thought of and the service is exceptionally fast
5
I'm pretty new to the bak kut teh world. This was he second place I tried it, the first being about two years ago at a stall in East Coast Park. The serving here is small, equivalent to three or four ribs, but it's really tasty and I love that they'll refill the soup broth. For a light, but healthy, lunch, this is good
5
Had lunch here. Visited as we want to try the famous bah kut teh. Which is pork rib soup with their own recipe. It is excellent. Very flavoursome with strong white pepper taste but not too spicy. Only a small menu. The other items are also very nice. Well worth a visit and very good value.
4
The Bak Kut Teh, cook with the best pork ribs which made you want to add one more bowl, the ribs very tender in our mouth.
4
the brand of song fa has live up till date. the peppery spicyness is making singaporean to love it. not much brands can compete with . and the location is so convenient. food standard is there but not the service provided.
5
Lots of shopping and food.to choose from. We enjoyed the Satay with Katuput and Murturbak also watching the food adds to the excitement of being and eating there
5
Been here lots of times and it never disappoints...service is excellent and everything is just perfect!
The dishes are like granmas cooking and taste is perfectly right!
Simply GREAT...keep up the good work SongFa!
5
This is one of the best place for Bakuteh. The soup taste good, they top up the soup continuously. The ribs were tender and tasty and so are all the other side dishes. We asked for minced garlic and we got it. The staff were very friendly and energetic. Our total bill for 2 was just $21.30. Will definitely return to this place for Bakuteh.
5
Yes...you read it right....its pork ribs time....So...eat lovers...head to Clarke Quay and just front the Clarke Quay central there is the store.Don't come on lunch time....the queue is looonnnnggg.....come after around 2pm and you are fine.Nice taste..and the soup is free flow...yess...free flow of the soup .....Enough talking...I am gonna eat my ribs now...
4
There is always a line for this place, but, in my opinion, it's worth it. When I was there, the line went by pretty quickly, although you might have to wait longer if you're in a larger group. The food here is excellent, and the service is quick and efficient. All the food that I tried was delicious, and there were so many others that I wanted to try as well, although the portions were a little small. I think it would be a good option for lunch rather than dinner.
4
Song Fa is rather famous for Bak Kut Teh as they have a few chain store. The soup is more of a pepper pork soup which is unique by itself. Always order their specialty with 2 long pork rib. As i dine often for lunch, sometimes i did notice the meat given is rather inconsistent. Sometimes I notice the bone is larger and little meat and I will ask for change.But in term of the taste wise, it is of top quality. Also came to know from my overseas colleagues that they like Singapore Bak Kut Teh, so when they are here, I will bring them to try this bak kut teh. To translate Bak Kut Teh in English means Pork Rib Soup Overall it is value for money and the soup is refillable. What i like about bak kut teh is the soup. Enjo
5
Very long waiting line is usually a good recommendation. In case of Song Fa Bak Kut The (try to pronounce it) is again true. I’ve got something like broth with pork rib – excellent and some cooked vegetables. Price extremely low and very fast service. For sure I will go there again
5
A road side restaurant opposite the Central at Singapore river. Need to queue any time you go there but it wont be long waiting as it goes fast. The famous rib soup is very delicious and the meat is very tender. You can ask You Za Kuei to go with the soup and the soup spreads in your mounth when you eat. It is said the Teocheo taste of Bak Kut Teh which is different from Ke Jia one that has stronger herb flavour. I see many Chinese Korean Japanese and Western tourests there. You experience real Singapore when you eat and sweat there
4
It was my first time eating Bak Kut Teh and I wasn't let down! I highly recommend going, the broth was 👌. A friend living in Singapore brought me...
3
Tried it many years ago, and the quality is intermittent, try by day, the soup is at the right taste. By night comes, it turns bland, and quality control is still a challenge for any food establishment to date.
Keep it up Song Fa !
4
So I have went to a few establishment like old town and outram bakkutteh place. Service wise for her is quite efficient when ordering but slow when refilling of soup. Price wise is average from the rest and definitely, I would come back here again.
4
- One of three branches in Chinatown, the others are at New Bridge Road- Flavourful soup, and has some of the better pork ribs I've tried so far.- Prominent location on the ground level of a shopping mall.- I'd suggest you visit the other branches too
4
I'm not a bak kut teh fans however when my friend brought me here I thought why not try. There were five of us and we ordered four bowls bak kut teh, rice, vegetables, nuts, youtiao, and chinese tea. The bak kut teh is really delicious and I changed my judgement of bak kut teh. I like it. Other "condiments" are also ok. Price wise is quite expensive but really worth to try
4
The pork rib is tender and the soup is nice with strong pepper flavour.The snapper fillet in soup is just cooked right. Flavour is very good and no fishy smell. Recommend to dine there if you don't mind it is crowded. Need to queue up
5
I loved this place. I even had two portions of the soup. It was peppery and delicious, the fried bread soaked in the soup was great and the port ribs were soft and tender. The restaurant was busy and hustling and the service was fast to meet the demands. I had never heard of Bak Kut Teh but its a new favorite now
5
We had Song Fa Bak Kut Teh 2 times during our 6 days trip.The first time we had it in clarke quay, and it was bette actually. But the only differnce is that the one in clarke quay gave us garlic in our soup which was what I like.The one in chinatown isn't bad too, and it was only the second time I found out you can keep refilling the soup in Bak Kut Teh! Very cheap and affordable, $7-8 SGD on average. I feel my hunger as I am writing this. Thats how good i think it is.
5
visited with my friend, this highly rated place is like a hawker stall but small and environment is nice, we went on the one on the corner (there are 2 right next to each other off of clark quay MRT stop). first time visitor, we really enjoyed the salted vegetables, braised peanuts, rice // the dough fritters (not my favourite) did not have much flavor. of course we tried the song fa, bak kut teh itself, pork leg soup, very yummy, highly recommended by locals. good and bad thing: an uncle walks around to refill the soup, so you really get full on soup itself but lose count on how many bowls you are enjoying. also--we went at 3pm on a weekday so there was NO crowd, otherwise lines are SUPER long! prices are good as well
3
It is fair to say that the taste of the 'bak kut teh' broth was good. But is it the best? I don't think so. Other bak kut teh stalls at nearby hawker centres like Chinatown Complex serve good bak kut teh as well, with legit-sized bowls and portions with generous top-ups of the broth
5
The best Bah Kut Teh! The perfect blend of herbs, garlic and pepper with meat so tender that makes this soup a favorite. Don't mind the long queue. It is worth it!
Price reasonable and serving big enough.
5
Delicious local food with reasonable price. When I am very hungry I usually go to this restaurant. lunch time there is so many people making a queue
4
I visited Song Fa Bak Kut Teh Chinatown Point with my friends who came from China for travelling. The queue was so long as usual and we waited nearly a half hour. I always like their Signature Rib Soup with deep-fried dough sticks. Everything was very good but the soup was a bit too salty. It still a good choice for going with foreign friends

This establishment has been going since the late 1960's and is recognised for great meals.My local friend recommended and we went along for dinner this evening.We both had Pork Rib soup with rice sharing kai lan, bean curd skins and peanuts. The meat just fell off the bone...delicious!The soup had a subtle pepper flavour and was topped up when needed..it was great.The fresh cut red chillies in dark soy sauce added the right amount of spice. This was followed by jasmine tea.The total cost was SD$27....top value with top service from friendly staff

Seemed a very popular local eatery so I joined the line. They are very efficient in the sense that the moment I joined the queue, I was handed a menu and ordered was taken before i was served a table. I ordered a bat kut teh (soup witg spare ribs) The soup was great and half way through they refiilled with more soup. It was not expensive and 5hey only take cash

This restaurant serving pork ribs soup has a modernair-conditioned tastefully done up interior.Orders are taken on a tablet too !Our party of four ordered individual bowls of pork ribssoup. The portions are fairly large.I addition, we ordered braised belly pork, stewed mustardgreens, kailan with oyster sauce.For drinks we had warm barley drink & a pot of pu-erh Chinesetea.I found the pork ribs soup satisfactory, though I favour a morerobust soup.The braised belly pork was nice and tender. We thought thisdish had our votes.The rest of the dishes are OK.What I like about this restaurant is a wait staff goes aroundtopping up your pork ribs soup without you having tosignal for soup refills.The total bill for 4 of us came up to SGD 65
5
Came for breakfast with Singaporean style bak ku teh. Ordered "dragon back" where the meat is very juicy. The portion is plentiful for breakfast (actually good portion for lunch!!!). Unlimited refill of soup which is peppery and delicious. The teh is good with either rice or fried dough. There is plenty of seating in and outside.
5
I was having my solo trip, last week and got a chance to stay at Chinatown, I've been to Singapore a zillion times but never got a chance to taste song fa bakuteh because of many reasons. Last trip, i decided to have it a try, and my dear lord...it was so delicious...the meat itself so tender and the soup was absolutely my taste. I ordered 1 plain rice, and 1 rib pork soup bakuteh along with ice lemon tea. And it only cost less than 10sgd. Absolutely gonna be back soon..
5
I walked by this place, saw the crowd and menu and made a mental note to return and I'm really glad I did. The pork rib soup is incredibly delicious. I love the pepperiness of the broth and enjoyed the add-ons such as pork stomach and tail. It feels like this place is always crowded, and it's easy to understand why. it's a great value, my meal was less than S$10 all-in. It's located just across New Bridge Road from the Clarke Quay Central, if you want an alternative to mall food, definitely check this place out
4
Not the typical Bah Kut teh that I'm used to from back home in Malaysia where the soup is darker, but this was tasty nonetheless.Everything tasted good.My only issue is that it was so crowded..that we felt cramped.Also there was always a long queue, so felt like we were being rushed.One good thing about a long queue, you can be assured that when you do get a table and order your food, your food arrives very quickly
5
My first time for Bak Kut Teh here is an amezing. can get more soup for free!
for a Pork is very smooth and very big! don't missed!
5
Yummy foods
We were even came back to the ahop the next day
Soup and meat are excellent
Pork belly too soft
Keep the quality

After hearing so much about Song Fa i decided to give it a go. This restaurant is definitely for pork and organ meat lovers hahaha. I ordered a bowl of Pork Ribs Soup with rice and a plate of vegetable; i really enjoyed it. What i like about it:1- It is soooo easy to get to; just inside Chinatown Point next to the China Town MRT2- There was a Q when i was there last night; 20/10, but it was a moving Q super fast plus there was a staff there taking everyone's order while you are waiting in the Q; thumb up! 3- The pork ribs itself comes with ordinary pork ribs or prime pork ribs; i ordered the ordinary pork ribs which was good;tender;the meat just comes off the bone plus there was lots of flavor from the meat4- I like it so much i bought a box of its spicy to take home with me5-No sharing of tables like in Hong Kong; thank god!6-service was super fast; my order was taken as i was standing in the line so ones i was given a table, sat down, my food arrived; thumb up! 7- there was a staff going round the tables to add soup to your pork ribs soup should you need it8- From the Q to the end of my meal it was very organised; i didn't have to wait much. When you finished with your meal, you only have to take your bill and walk up to the cashier to pay it; fabulous; love it! 9-Reasonably price; i paid $14 for my pork ribs soup. Note: This place might not be suitable for children under a certain age; my 9 years old son definitely wouldn't like eating this kind of food; the soup is peppery; it is supposed to be peppery so he wouldn't like it nor could he eat it. There was no kids menu; it is not that kind of a restaurant; it is gear towards adults. Overall, it was a lovely experience for me; i would definitely go there again next time when i come back to Singapore 
5
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is one of the best local restaurants in town.You definitely must try the pork rib soup. I love how the spices invigorates your senses. It was truly a masterpiece. It always has a long long queue but it is definitely worth it. At that friendly price, it is also amiable to group of friends dining after any activities.
4
Pretty much every bit of a pig is served here (and nothing other than pig!) and offal, intestines, ear and tail normally dont appeal to Western tastes. They dont especially appeal to me either, but the soup stock is flavourful, as is the braised pork belly (though its not as firm as every other pork belly I've eaten). The staff were very friendly (perhaps because not many white folks eat there?) and helpful. And its cheap as chips. Would definitely revisit to get my pork fix.
5
We were hungry and just selected the best around on trip advisor; for me it was a great choice, but I had to take my wife inside the mall at Delifrance for her meal, as pork is not an option; now, the pork soup here was excellent, I took the ribs and tenderloin, also two different vegetable side dishes and a rice, plus chestnut water, all for only 24sgd; if you like pork, this is a great place; by noon there are two queues, one from outside (faster) and another one inside the mall (cooler, a/c); enjoy 
4
The place is always packed but waiting time is quick and efficient. Always impressed with the service, there was one lady serving our table who was extremely attentive and courteous every time she refilled our soup, I visited with my china business partners, they actually insisted to have song fa because they missed it so much frm their first trip. They were v happy and satisfied after the meal. Great that Chinatown point has a outlet with air con! Previously had at Clarke quay. Yum tum
5
I've made and ate spareribs soup before, but this dish is very special. At Song Fa they serve the clear soup version. It tasted delicious, very balance and especially if you dip the Chinese doughnut in it, you won't be able to stop slurping up all of that goodness. One of the nice thing is that the restaurant will serve more broth should you run out of it before you finish your ribs. About the meat, it was tender and easily stripped off with your chopstick... :). You can order rice with it, we shared the rice between 2 people as we really want to enjoy the soup. I bought some dry ingredients and will be making it to keep a piece of Singapore with me until next time
5
This is one of the best Bak Kut Teh restaurant in Singapore. I would recommend the pork ribs, pork tail, liver, pork stomach. The ribs is a must try dishes so delicious. The service is very good. You must go together with the plain rice and 油炸鬼
4
By far one of the best Bak Kut Teh in town and reasonably priced. For most valued and easy to each order the Pork slices instead of the ribs, you get more meat and no bones to deal with. A truly satisfying meal for about SGD10 per pax, you can add in You Tiao (fried crullers), salted vege and home made bailey drink.So far my favorite is the branch at UE Biz Hub East in Changi Business Park, where the queue is short and fast and the place cool to chill out on a hot day. I brought my family and also overseas guests to this place and we have thoroughly enjoyed the food,I have use this as a benchmark for other Bak Kut Teh joints, many have failed to live out to my expectations.Kudos, keep it out
5
Bak kut teh . ..It very delicious . ..I never had before .......
A must visit if you are in Singapore - cannot recommend it more :) I will certainly be telling all of my friends about it!
3
We ordered the pork ribs soup and pork tenderloin both were Good. The services kinda fast. Didn't have to wait too long for foods. Also bills provide after all orders been served.
5
This place is always busy but lucky for us we didn't wait for long to get a table. While waiting, we were given the menu to order and once we sat down, we didn't wait for long for the food to come out. The soup was very delicious and I think it's the most important part of bak kut teh. By far, the best bak kut teh I've ever had
5
There are a lot of places that claim to be the best bak kut teh in the island. And sometimes it all depends on which type of bak kut teh you prefer. If you are like me, and you have a craving for the peppery goodness of the broth, and you love your pork ribs as tender as they can be, then Song Fa is the one for you. During peak hours, be prepared to queue, but their service is quick so you don't have to wait long after you're seated for your orders to arrive. They have two branches that you can go to if you're in town: 1) Opposite the Central Mall (MRT station: Clarke Quay); 2) Chinatown Point Mall (MRT station: Chinatown). This is definitely a value-for-your-money restaurant
4
I’ve tried Bak Ku Teh at several places in Singapore - Song Fa is my favorite because of their easy-to-eat pork rib. Will definitely go frequently if they open a joint in Tokyo.One thing to note, the refilled soup is super hot. I got my lips burnt
3
Much hype had been heard thus I made a trip there. We ordered the Pork ribs ( small serving) not the Prime Ribs with a small plate of green vegetable (small portion), a small saucer of braised groundnuts, a small serving of pig's liver in soup, salted vegetable each and two bowls of noodles plus a small pot of Chinese Tea (Pu'er) . TThe pork rib soup was slightly of the salty side and I could taste a slight tinge of MSG (may be I was wrong). The braised groundnuts could had been softer and the salted vegetable was coated with oil. There are also other dishes but we did not place the order
1
There are plenty places to serve Bak Kut Teh, went to those hawkers in Lau Bat Sat, Maxwell Street Foid Center, Chinatown food centres, or even other small shops or food courts in Sands mall. They are all much better than this one !! Because this shop has been jammed with tour groups, leaded by tour guides and therefore the services their is absolute awful ! The tour group members are noisy and I got kicked all the time by waiters . The last day of Singapore, I tried to visit this shop again as this shop looks highly recommended online, but things never got better, seats really crowded and treated awful again ! Just go to hawker centres, more fun and talk to the owners, treated nicer and excellent experience ! So why go here ?
4
before it open in jakarta, when i go to singapore i often came here.really nice bakkutteh,the pig rib are tender and juicy.the soup also just right in your tongue.always crowded during lunch time.have too wait in along row to be seated but worth it.also nice vibe,just around the corner of the boat quay.you can ask to add the soup again for free
4
I went to the SongFa Bak Kut Teh shop near the Chinatown Station. Before I travel Singapore I found it originally Airline's website, pilot recommended this restaurant. I think that there are at least 3 Song Fa restaurants in Singapore. Luckily I could enter smoothly , I ordered Bak Kut Teh and begitable fried. Both are wonderful taste! Soup with bone is so tasty. As there are a lot of local people so that I recommend to go
4
It was a chance thing that we came across Song Fa Bakuteh but it turned out to be a great experience. We hadn't eaten since morning and had been waiting for someone who got delayed and were very hungry. It was an off day so most places in the office building at Expo were closed. This was one of the few open places and it as a good choice we made.Well lit, spacious, warm and welcoming the decor, ambience and the staff all are up to the mark. There were a few other people dining but it was still a very peaceful place.We took our seat near the window which was lined with tiny plants. The place smells very fresh.We asked for suggestions for tea and ordered the traditional Chinese tea. The best thing is that the guy comes to your table and prepares the tea in front of you. It is very interesting process to watch and I will add the video for it when it is ready. The tea was very refreshing and they do not mind if you wish to refill.For food we ordered:- Chicken Feet 4/5 It was the first time I tried it. In India it is something that mostly the poor take from the butchers shop. But now I think I will also be more than willing to buy and cook at home. The meat was very fleshy and somehow tasted like eggs. Well cooked and well served. You can view the fun video we created by following this link https://www.facebook.com/SubhashaniandVinimay/videos/vb.1070114097/10205752474105654/?type=3- Pigs Trotters which was again a very well cooked dish. The meat was soft and juicy. Both dishes were a good hearty meal for two people.- Water Chestnut juice for which I think we still need to develop the taste. Me and my husband could not finish the juice between the two of us and had to order another drink.They also served us the traditional Baku Teh Soup which was very good but one has to drink it when it is hot or warm.All in all it was a good experience. The bill was around SGD22 so will keep it in the mid-range places. If you are on a low budget travel, like we were, then it was a luxury that we were forced to add to our itinerary but it was not disappointing
4
Came here with a group of colleagues. We have order Bak Kut Teh soup and some other side dishes for lunch. Food were nice especially the soup that you can refill.
4
Brought family here. Ordered one normal pork rib and another premium rib which was softer due to higher fat content. Also had pig intestine, peanuts, braised pork belly. Soup spicy but quite fatty. Daughter finished whole bowl of mee sua.
3
Generally I like ribs. No matter how it is made. Good with barbeque or steam or boiled in white hot pepper source soup. Black sauce was quite sweet. Garlic added some more favour to the experience.
4
The line out the front full of locals confirm this is one of the better Bak kut Teh places in Singapore. Lovely soup and meaty ribs. Located directly opposite Chillies near Clarke key train station.
4
There is a popular and recommended Chinese restaurant opposite There is a popular and recommended Chinese restaurant.+ Location : opposite The Clark Quay Central Department Store. You can drop at Clark Quay MRT Station.+ Food : There are mid-range price with good quality of foods
3
I was at its Seletar Mall outlet, queued 20mins during dinner-time. No reservations. i am impressed by how well-managed is the place. When we were showed to our table, the dishes were ready. Soup was good, not quite heavenly. The staff plied us with generous and piping hot soup refill. Vegetables were cut a tad too small and disappointing
2
I have frequented this place whenever there are friends coming over to Singapore so they could try one of the famous dishes in Singapore. I prefer bringing them to this place because of the accessibility to MRT and buses. However, if I got other better options, I think I would not.Okay, food is not bad. The Braised Pork Knuckle actually is good. Bak Kut Teh is not bad. It's just that the meat is a bit tough, and there is a limit to the soup refill (the servers would actually tell you that it is your last time to get a refill! Really Song Fa???). And they are charging 0.60 cents for a small cup of tap water which is not even full! And when you ask for a refill, they would ask you to pay another 0.60 cents!Price, I would say is usual for what is suppose to be "the best" bak kut teh shop. But for such service that you are charging that much even on tap water, or telling customers that it is their last refill of soup, it is not like we are going for 5th refill or something, and the bowl is not even that big, I would say you are overpriced. Customers are paying for the whole experience. I don't understand that for such service, the shop is still being queued for.I don't know how it was during Song Fa's peak of popularity, but get your game up Song Fa. You are suppose to be one of the best if not the best. You've got serious competition out there, and some are far better than you are in terms of taste, service, and value for money
5
The favourite menu was a rib soup called "Bak Kut The", which is a part of restaurant name. The soup is best to accompany with rice and some side dishes, e.g. cooked pig intestines and some vegetable dishes. The soup is unlimited and the staffs will refill you the soup as much as you request. Must try
5
Surprisingly good! It's like SG's version of Sinigang (Filipino dish). Moreso the soup is unlimited! The staff will readily pour more soup to your bak kut teh if requested. I love it! We loved it so much that we even bought their powedered mix as take home. I am looking forward to making my very own version of Bak Kut Teh at the comfort of my own home.Make sure to come early to beat the queue. They have 2 sites located in the Central area. One is indoor and I guess with AC while the other one is open air type of eatery. Apart from Bak Kut Teh my friends also ordered pig intestines and chicken feet for myself. Nothing exceptional about the chicken feet
2
Lousy place for Bak Kut Teh.The soup only taste pepper and garlic. No sweetness of meat or pork ribs.The pork ribs are so tough and no meat and sweet taste.All other dishes order also failed to impress any one in our group of 5.Over rated place. Go to those smaller shops in hawker centres should be better
4
Great Pork Ribs Soup (Bak Kut Teh). Peppery version. Must try. Many tourists. A Singapore local delicacy must try. Long queue. Prepare to wait.
3
we're lucky that we stayed close by so could come anytime when the queue was not so long. i wouldnt say it's not a good place. the food was okay but maybe i'm into something else. anyway, it's worth a try.
2
You can easily taste better Bak Kut Teh elsewhere.
Do not understand why there is always a queue there, perhaps is because of the convenience location.
5
This delicious nourishing food was a family favourite. The kids were miserable and tired from jet lag but after slurping nearly their own weight in soup and some great braised pork belly, we walked a good 12 km with no complaints. Amazing.
4
Song Fa Bank Kut Teh is definitely one of the more famous Bak Ku Teh stores in Singapore. There is definitely better stores out there.
5
Overall, i love the food. You'd better go here at late meal-time because it' s usually full of people to eat here. The service it's okay. And you dont need much time to wait for the food to come. Love it!
4
For the best Bak Kut Teh in Spore for the special Ribs quality & the pepery thick broth, Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh used to be my best choice until they sold off the franchise & cash out. Thereafter I chose to go to Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh as the 2nd choice. My recent 1st visit to Song Fa & looking at the long Q, I was blown away with the quality of the food. It is now my best choice for Bak Kut Teh 
5
Love the unlimited soup and delicious bak kut teh. Be sure to go early because the queue is quite long when it comes lunch and dinner time. I have tried their store in clarke quay and the staff are very accommodating and will assist you right despite of the crowd
5
Savory and Spicy! Fantastic place for pork lovers!This pepper based broth is their house speciality with traditional offerings of Fried Fritters, Braised Intestines, Pickled Mustard, Braised Belly Pork, Braised Knuckles, etc.Top ups for soup is free. Ask for it!Note: they have a varied selection of traditional teas for that soothing finish
4
If you are looking for local Singaporean Bak Kut Teh, then this is the place. There are a few Song Fa restaurants around the city, so check first to avoid unnecessary traveling.Song Fa provides one of the best Bak Kut Teh around the city with regard to taste. And just like other Bak Kut Teh shops around, they provides unlimited soup refills, which is best served wit rice. They also have quite a few Chinese dishes available. Soup packets are also available for take away.The shop is a bit small, however, so one might find the shop a little tight.Overall, if you are looking for great Bak Kut Teh, then Song Fa is definately worth visiting, but if you are looking to try a variety of Singaporean crusine, then you are better off visiting a food court, where you can also find Laska and Chicken Rice
4
Not much different with other Bak kut teh that I have till now, very sprice, peppery. But still, the soup and rib is good taste.
5
This is definitely the best Bak Kut Teh restaurant in Singapore. I really love the pepper soup of the Bak Kut Teh. Their ribs are very tasty as well. After all, they are in very good price.
5
I love the taste of Chinese herbal medicine! Soup could be refilled which I had some much rice with soup together. And it's quite healthy as not much oil used. Love the service as well staff were friendly.
4
We ordered a signature Bak Kut Teh, 2 noodles, 1 油炸鬼。total sg 16.2 dollars. The soup is vey good and can free to refill, they staffs are with very good service.
5
hv try many type of bak kut teh in singapore, but this place is the best, cause the staffs are very friendly and smiling all the time when they see you, the pork rib soup are diffent from others place in singapore.
5
They have a few restaurants in the city. I went to the original one that is opposite Clark quay. It's usually crowded in the evening. I ordered pork rib soup, fried dough, preserved vegetables, braised intestines, bean curd sheets and steam rice. Very good and delicious
4
I haven't tried the Song Fa in Indonesia, but this was my very first time to Song Fa in Singapore so I can't compare which better, but I bet the original here much better, yes? We ordered Pork Tenderloin, Cakue, Salt Vegetables, Braised Pork Belly, and Pork Ribs. While I'm waiting for the food, I took some time and seeing the atmosphere, it was really old-skool and literally antique without any furnished or fake old-furnitures. The ambiance feels like taking me back to 1980s Chinatown (well, I never been there tho' but it feels that way).The food came to our table, and we enjoyed it! I especially love their broth! Free-flow broth, haha! Everytime they see the bowl was run out the broth, they will re-fill it again. And I dipped the Cakue into the broth, yummy! I also enjoyed the minced Pork Tenderloin so much! It was a really good good lunch to boost my energy full for a day! Yeay
4
Must try this Bak Kut Teh. The spare ribs are well cooked and tender. The soup is delicious and free refill. Apart from Bak Kut Teh, they also serve other pork dishes and equally delicious. We had our lunch there and apparently pack of people during that time. If you dont want to queue, come earlier or come slightly later. The location is easy to find. Stop at Clarke Quey MRT station and walking distance from there
5
I dont have to go all the way to Balestier, as l am always around Chinatown. Its good and tasty with reasonable price like good old days along beach road. I love the new branch at chinatown point very helpful service orientated staffs from young to mature ones. Well done!To our tourist , a must stay in chinatown n must try this traditionally pork rib soup & other dishes serve in Singapore. REMEMBE
4
Bak kut teh is good. Pork rib, tenderloin, and fish is tender. Soup is hot and peppery. Don't order their veg. I had their cai xin. I think even my mum can cook better. Although it's a bit expensive, it's still worth the try. Make sure you check your receipt because they charge you together with wet tissue without asking.
4
Accidentally found this place, we were walked around our apartment in Clark Quay. Bored with restaurant food in the area, we decided to try this bakuteh stall. It turned out to be one of our decision. Definitely will comeback again sometimes this year
4
Bah Kut Teh here is yum, authentic, with free soup refill. Drinks are pricey and staff here are more interested in each other than in serving clients with sincerity. Don't expect a warm welcome, just have the bah kut teh and go.
3
Waited about 30 minutes which is totally crazy and too expensive for the average taste of Bak Kut Teh. You can find better one (my personal preference) at Hong Lim complex food centre.
4
My husband loves the unlimited supply of soup as pepper taste was so yummy. The pork ribs was tender and juicy and the meal was reasonably priced. Not forget the barley drink also a must try for first timer.
4
As compared to many bakutehs in Singapore, Song Fa are amongst the top tier. Its pig trotters are a must try, and soup is above average and consistent on my many visits there. Value for money restaurant.
4
Had lunch with my friend there. Got there about 12pm. Managed to get a seat, however, shortly after, the queue swelled.The servers were very efficient. They served fast thus manage to clear the lunch crowd pretty fast. I am not a big fan of pork ribs but I had always enjoyed the fish soup using the same pork base as the pork ribs. My friend ordered the pork ribs soup. Together we shared a plate of vegetables, beancurd skin and pig trotters. The pig trotters is particularly enjoyable. Meat is tasty and breaks easily from the bone. Gives you a feel of how long the pig trotters have been cooked. Would consider an enjoyable meal.:
4
Great bak kut teh, though not very impressive. Still attracts long lines so be there early! They have another stall just a few shops down the street so there are 2 separate lines. It's more pricey than other bak kut teh stalls and I personally prefer the one right behind Bugis Junction (more peppery, better value for money, still popular but no long queues :))
4
Looks like the usual food stall but we (3 guys on business) liked it especially the food. A Singaporean friend recommended it and made the booking for us otherwise we would probably not find it and enjoying a long queue. That's what friends a for. Coming back is definitely an option
4
I was eating here on sunday with some friends, and yes, this Bak Kut Teh always sooo packed , but lucky us, we didn't wait that long, and we ordered so many things for 5 people, tried these - tried those hahaha and Yes... It's sooo yummyyy , and the pork ribs, lamb soup was soooo tender, I always love kidney too, sooooo good !!! WORRH TO TRY !!!
4
A family run business that was started by his dad and now it's one of the most famous bak kut teh in Singapore. Do go during off peak hours to enjoy your food as the place is always very crowded there is air con seatings as it can get warm in the afternoon. Parking is limited there hence you may have to walk a distance to reach it via the MRT. Can always ask for the soup to be top up for free. Service is fast as there are lots of people working there
4
Good and tasty soupe, free refill, I've not tried other pork rib soup in Singapore, but this is definitely a good place to be.
4
Order the "dragon back" which is really juicy and tender. The soup is unlimited supply. Forget about the veggie but the chicken feet is good too. They open early so i can do breakfast and lunch and dinner there. Definitely will go back
5
I really love the pepper pork soup! And it's free to refill!!!
I went there alone, so didn't wait too long, being served with 10min!!!
So delicious! So good! It's definitely a "must go place" in Singapore!
4
We tried pork rib soup and some side dishes. They were tasty, but just that we prefer stronger taste soup base, like those in ng ah sio which is darker in color and stronger in flavor.... it seemed to me that the ng ah soi has more side dishes options.... but both are nice and worth trying
5
Take a simple business model - limited offerings, reasonable prices, cash only business, fast turnover, and give customers what they want. If you can do this for a long time (since 1967?) you must be doing something right, and you will have people queuing up to get in. That's Song Fa Bak Kut Teh.There is the big corner place (11 New Bridge Road) and the newer outlet in Chinatown Point Centre. I went to the "overflow" shopfront at 17 New Bridge Road.It's crowded and noisy, you sit on stools, you might have to queue, but it's a very satisfying experience.Of course, I had the Bak Kut Teh: the pork ribs were chewy but tender, fall-off-the-bone, the broth was porky and peppery, there was enough rice, and I had a good plate of greens (Kai Lan). I didn't see anyone having a beer, so I had a glass of the home-made barley water.The bill ("Pay now" said the waitress as I ordered) was $S16.Sometimes you need to go with the classics, and this is a classic
4
This is one of the best bak kut teh that I have eaten. The peppery soup is so invigorating & the pork ribs so tasty.However the place is a bit cramp. They have 2 branches in this area that is near to each other. A new more comfortable branch opened recently in nearby Chinatown Point.Definitely will come back again
4
It's located near Clarke Quay, long queue, but you can order when you are queuing, so the wait is only about 15mins on a Saturday. Of course serving is very fast too. I didn't know it's pepper soup, I was looking forward for some tea or herb taste. It still taste alright. Other small dishes like chicken feet are quite nice. It's not expensive compare what we spent in Jumbo seafood.(another popular restaurant) a taxi driver told us no sign board seafood if famous too, but we didn't have time to visit. It's also in Clarke Quay.
4
@TheKuoKnowsBak Kut Teh or Meat Ribs in Soup is Singapore history in a bowl. Originally designed to be an inexpensive breakfast for labourers, it is now a sumptious meal that anyone can enjoy morning, noon or night.Song Fa's pork ribs in a peppery broth with a bowl of white rice is enough as a meal in itself. It is probably not necessary to order anything else. But that could be a mistake.A plate of salted vegetables complements the meal delightfully. So too does a helping of dough fritters to dunk into the soup, as and when. Incidentally, the broth is bottomless. So just ask for a top up when you need.If you are not dining "al solo", then consider a plate of braised pig's trotter as well. The meat just falls off the bone with a gentle prod.Song Fa makes dining a pleasure. Ordering is effortless; service is timely and the quality is consistent. What more can a diner ask for
4
when i reach here, i was shock cos the q so long, but lucky their service very fast, so i just need wait less then 10 minutes...the food is nice, price also not bad. lot foreigner eat here as well. the staff so fast pouring our soup when almost finis
5
I write to extend my appreciation to your manager "Ah Leong" (sorry, I didn't have his official name) at New Bridge Branch. He is excellent in managing the shop with sincere manner and enthusiasm.On 25.3.2015, we go to Songfa (New Bridge) shop in a group of seven Hong Kong visiters (2 elders on wheelchair, 1 child and 4 adults). We recieved warm welcome from the waiters although they were busily engaged with the full house guests. Food were delicious. We made encore orders.As the shop was close to Parliament House, the traffic was choatic at that night due to the memorial service to the Singapore's founding father. Taxi was difficultto get, esp. our destination is Sentosa. Failure to get taxi for almost 30 minutes. We sought help from manager Leong. Without hesitation, he and a female assistant dedicatedly fetched taxi through phone and web. With their kind assistance for 30 minutes, we eventually get two cabs at 23:15. We were so grateful for their kind assistance.Yet, sorry for delaying their off~time.Once again, our family and I would like to present our deepest gratitude to manager Leong as well as the female assistant

The soup is so delicious even if we drink it cold.
And the meet is very soft and tender as well.
5
This is a very busy and crowded Restaurant. They sell bakut teh and some side dishes. I like the taste and always eat here at least once everytime I visit singapore .
4
A no frills dish of ribs, delicately cooked in herbs, garlic and minimal sodium is a treat that any visitor to Singapore should try. The soup is non-stop.
4
If you are in Singapore, try the Bak Kut teh -- the ethnic dish at the old restaurant at new bridge road. if you want to try it at a much cozy place, walk a few yards at ChinaTown Point
4
The meat and the soup is really delicious, its also combine with salt vegetables....really yummy, but we should queue especially on the lunch time.
5
So after many recommendations from work colleagues based out of Singapore, we went to Song Fa for lunch. Known for its Pork Ribs, we ordered the food while we standing in the queue to get a table. There are 2 Song Fa's couple of steps away from each other...Though the quality at both is the same (as told by the SG colleague) Courteous stewards, super fast service and yummy food is going to get me back to this restaurant for lunch. Pocket friendly menu. We had ordered Pork Ribs soup, kai lan, plain rice and mee sua soup and enjoyed everything. Must go if you want to eat something local and authentic SG food.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is Teochew style with black pepper, soup are refillable, but compared to other Bak Kut Teh I found it to be very average though. During the afternoon and dinner there are a lot of people, need to wait a while or share table with others. Price is a bit expensive for a normal bowl of Bak Kut Teh though
5
Well, this is my fave place to have my bak kut teh. I love everything that they serve. The bak kut (pork ribs) is so tender. And make sure you try the pig's leg (i forgot the name, but you can ask the waiter). Even my friend who dislike pork (he ate fish soup), he said it's tasty. The bak kut teh and the fish soup have the same ingredients for the soup (i think). But for someone who can't stand for the spiciness from the pepper, i think you still have to try it. It's worth it and you'll never get enough..
4
Been coming here to have Bak kut teh for years now!! Loving the peppery taste of the soup! Queue can be long at certain times as its that good, but the open till late so supper time is also the best place to head to! :
3
Compared to several other Bak Kut Teh in Singapore, Song fa can only be considered as average. A group of us went there at 1:30pm, and waited in the queue for 40 minutes. Despite the big crowd, most of them were tourists from mainland China. The soup was not tasty, and the pig liver was too thin and overcooked.
4
Nice food and taste , fast service and good ambient .
Price is ex for local but resonablw for tourist. There r many tourist there. Still can't win over marsiling blk 19 bak kut teh.
4
it's not only pork loin soup, they also have other Chinese dishes in this store. Where we went is close Clark quey, there are two Song-Fa near by I think it's because too may customers.
1
Not good, soup is only half bowl, staff is very unpolite and cannot be refilled. You must paid S$0.2 for wet towel without notified before
4
We chanced upon this establishment while exploring the city and it seemed a nice alternative to the the chain restos and and bar food along the river. It's cash-only, so be ready for that and staff who are very focused on efficiency and getting people in and out (there's often a line).Also, be ready to be friendly and share a table! We were seated next to a friendly local who was happy to give us some travel tips over the delicious pork dishes that were served up. Their food tastes great and they dish it up pretty fast.I'd recommend it to any visitor looking to get exposure to some local flavor
4
Visited their outlet at Seletar mall with friend and family members. We ordered their famouse Bak kut Teh soup, braised Pig trotters, Salted Vegetables, Braised Peanuts, Braised Pork belly, Steamed Kailan, Steamed Xiao bai cai and a pot of pu er tea. Overall bill was about $57. The serving is just nice and the soup is refillable as many times as you want. Overall their bak kut Teh is one of the best but their service could be improved
5
Recently went to this main branch that located just opposite Clark Quay Mrt station with my China relatives that visited us during this Chinese New Year. It was so crowded when we reached there and was packed full house but we were consider lucky to get our seat as we were in the No.1 queue ( we reached there at 530pm) and just nice one big group of customers was leaving. Their ribs was tender and their side dishes was delicious. Service staff was quite fast to our response although i can see the waiting queue was getting longer and longer outside the restaurant. Soup was refilled immediately when you hints to their service staff without any extra charges. Their soup is so delicious that i drank almost 7 bowls ..... hehehe .My China relatives was so impressed by their food and they bought their ready to cook Bat Kut Teh incredents packet ( $22) after our meal
5
Song fa @ Chinatown Point. 133 new bridge road. Nearest MRT stop is chinatown exit chinatown point and pops out very close to the shop. Very meaty ribs and tasty soup which was topped up without asking. The pig's small,intestine is very tasty too,if you fancy trying something different. We were a party of 5 and everyone was extremely satisfied .
3
Planned to go to another restaurant above it and went down the wrong stairs. This place was very busy. Lots of patrons and the wait staff were very efficient but cold/robotic. I had a pork tail soup which was very satisfying and I guess...interesting. The soup base didn't seem to be strongly seasoned as I would like it to be, but I'm not sure if this is the way it's supposed to be, not ever having tried Bak Kut Teh before. I found it odd that people would discard their bones right on the table. After leaving, the wait staff would simply wipe up the table, pushing the bones into a bucket. I didn't see them use any kind of cleaner for the table
5
We went for dinner last night upon recommendation from a gentleman my husband is working with. 10 minute wait but they take your order in line so when you sit the food comes right away. It was delicious, like crock pot roast. I had the same thing for lunch at a hawker stall in Chinatown though and it was just as good for $4.50 for all including rice and soup. Tonight my meat was 8.50, rice was extra. I got pig trotter(leg). Then I saw a picture of pig belly so ordered that, too. Tasted just like the trotter. Delicious!
4
We have to wait for around 10minutes to be seated.. the restaurant i see was always full.. we ordered bak kut teh, fish and veggie. All very nice and very fast served. You can ask for the free refill for the soup. The soup for me is a bit spicy, they have too much pepper in it.. but overall, it is nice and must try!
5
Long lines during peak meal times so be prepared to wait. We sometimes intentionally avoid peak time but then they run out of the premium pork ribs fast.
Apart from pork ribs soup I recommend the boiled ground nuts and pickled vegetables.
5
Highly recommended! Kids loved the soup...food really good 👍 line was little bit long but moving...fast and frindly service
4
plump tender ribs, flavourful peppery soup topped up when low, we visited the changi outlet, not for the first time and the quality has been consistent every time.
When craving bak kut teh choose Song Fa you will not be disappointed
5
This is the best bak kut teh I've ever had. We went for a late lunch (around 2pm) and there was no line - we were quickly ushered to our seats and ordered. The food was delicious and the service was quite friendly and efficient (unlike a lot of other places). It was a quick walk from Clarke Quay MRT, opposite Central Mall. I would definitely return for more
4
There are two types of bak kut teh. The clear soup and the dark soup.This place serves the clear soup bak kut teh with pepper soup. Deliciousness. ...Place always packed during lunch and dinner. But don't know how office workers can eat there during lunch ad it's pretty warm, especially with the boiling hot soup in the Claypots Just 10mins walk from bugis junction mrt.Well worth the wal
4
One of the best Bak Kut Teh shops in Singapore. Tasty ribs with great soup will attract you to come once again. Set meal is the best to complete meal (rice, soup, ribs, fried veggie). Price is about the same with other Bak Kut Teh shops. Worth for money. But this shop is almost every time crowded especially in the afternoon. Should try once if you love ribs.
3
The soup is quite salty. Many people think it is delicious. Well, basically it is a simple soup by putting some ribs and herbs together. It is originated from Chinese labour. They had harsh life and looked for something for their health. At that time, they only had some local herbs and ribs that were of low price. They boiled that together to have the soup. In fact, you can't expect too much
4
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is a very hectic restaurant. Located across Clarke Quay MRT. You can only eat there, no time for chit chat or hang around with friends in the restaurant, because the people in queue line will staring at you. The Bak Kut Teh is very delicious, you can choose what kind of pork meat you want inside your Bak Kut Teh. You also can refill the soup stock
4
Try to get there during non-peak hours - either before 11 am or after 3pm before the dinner crowd. Come prepared to sweat and there may be a long wait!However once you get your table, service is brisk and efficient. We went for the premium loin ribs, braised bean curd skin, salted vegetables and dough fritters. Piping hot peppery soup gets topped up once. All very delicious!We even brought back a box of the bak kut teh spices to enjoy at home
4
Very easy location as it's just across Central World Mall steps away from Clarke Quay MRT. We went at around 5:30pm and were very fortunate to have no queue waiting so got seated quite quickly. Their Bah Kut Teh is definitely worth a try as they have quite a tender and meaty pork rib with unlimited refilling of the soup base. The soup tastes very pepper intense and meaty. I also ordered the soft-boned pork loin (豬軟骨) and came away equally impressed as it's also well seasoned and the same quality as the one served in the Bak Kut Ten. We ordered a boat load for 2 px and the bill only came to SGD25, greatly satisfied
3
crowdy even in the morning
some kind staff but way too salty...
these kinds were my favorites before, but too salty.
3
First of all, the restaurant didn't hv air con, fan only. It's extremely hot! We ordered 2 different flavor BKT. It's not like Taiwan style, the BKT in Singapore is with very strong pepper which I don't like. I prefer 葯材味stronger.
4
Whenever I crave for Bah Kut Teh, I head over to Song Fa. IMO, they serve amongst the best bah kut teh in Singapore. Soup is tasty and meat is always tender. Only thing i dislike the the never-ending crowd.
5
Ordered their pork ribs soup. The meat almost separates instantly from the bone, and the soup, it has this peppery taste that makes you want more.
4
Tender and aromatic premium pork ribs and loins with additional orders of pork knuckle & intestines made one enjoyable dinner!
4
Had this Bak Kut Teh opposite the central mall. Always crowded there. Reach there at 12 noon is already full house. Food was really nice. The soup was the essential of everything. But just a bit pricey. They are opening another one at the old Chinatown mall. Beside Mcdonald.Will try them again.
4
Bak kut teh, literally means "meat bone tea," but is actually a soup combining pork ribs with various herbs and spices. When I first ate at this place, around 2012, I don't need to queue to be seated .So far , I am satisfied with the taste of the food here , especially Pork Ribs Soup. The meat is very tender.Remember, this place is closed every Monday
4
After walking by and seeing this place constantly packed the day before we decided to give it a try in the morning to beat the crowds. An online reviewer led us astray when they indicated the restaurant opened at 7 am. We ended up stalking the place for 2 hours while taking in the sights along the Singapore River until they opened at 9.We ordered the pork ribs and pork tenderloin and were not disappointed. The seasoning they use is so delicious they sell it separately. There were also more adventurous meat options to try if you are inclined. We would eat there again, only not as early
4
Sure, you can take this review with a grain of salt, as it was my first BKT, so what do I know? Right?As we all know, this is not Singapore's best BKT, but it is meant to be decent and it is central, which is why it is so popular in the first place.I watching this restaurant over a few days and around lunch time is was packed, with lines 10-20 deep waiting to get in. Can they all be wrong?Firstly, for those complain about the queue, (particularly visitors) don't visit during lunch peak. I turned up between 10-11am and walked in to a half empty restaurant. Ordered and eating within 5 mins - problem solved.I was told that BKT is an acquired taste and that I wouldn't like Song Fa for that reason. However I thought the broth was flavoursome. The pork was extremely tender and just fell of the bone. Quite delicious and satisfying. I ordered a serve of the Kai Lan to go with it which was the perfect side dish.All in all a great first BKT and an enjoyable experience at Song Fa

Visiting Singapore, I seriously have to do a food trip. And on top of my food list is Bak Kut Teh (sorry it's not the Chili Crab). I dream of this peppery pork soup ever since I tried cooking it back home. Local stories I've heard from my dad is that people would drink that soup early mornings to wake them up. Singapore is a foodie's haven with hawker centers almost everywhere. I've searched different hawker's center and I couldn't find the bak kut the in any of the places I visited except the one in china town. Thankfully, my Aunt lent me her Makkansutra guide (This book is a must for people who wants to go on a food trip in Singapore). That's where I read about Song Fa, and since I have other places to go to, I have to pick a location where in it's the easiest place for me to go to. The one in Clarke Quay, right across Central.I arrived there a little bit after 10am. Missing the breakfast crowd (and also a good time to enjoy the soup without the restaurant being too full). The restaurant itself is like going in an old fashion chinese tea house. Service wise, very typical, you order, you pay and then they serve you. I think it will be easier if you know what you will order already. Don't expect great restaurant service, like any busy tea house, you just go there to eat. And of course, I ordered their Bak Kut Teh, the pork rib one, and misua (thin egg noodles with soup). I was so excited with the food I had to remind myself to take photos so I can document it. The broth is just right for me, just the right blend of herbs and pepper. I don't want it too peppery nor do I want it too watered down. If you have colds, it will definitely help you. The meat was tender and flavorful. The misua is just right, not over cooked. This was my first Bak Kut The in Singapore and so far the best one I've tasted. Price wise, it's decent for the whole meal. And just for extra, a cup of water is 30 cents and the wet tissue is 20 cents
5
Even full of visitors, the restaurant serve you faster than McDonDon :) This is a must-try restaurant in Singapore for visitors.
5
we heard about this food long time ago and now I had a chance to try it, It was so good!, the staffs were so helpful and very kind, I love this place
5
Best bakkutteh I've had! We had breakfast here. Soup is peppery and refreshing. Note that its closed on Mondays.
3
Returned here as friends wanted to bring overseas guests for their 1st bak kut teh. It was Saturday 2pm and there were still long lines at both shops! Luckily the line moved fast and we got seats in about 20minsThe place is filled to capacity and it's elbow to elbow, so it's very uncomfortable . The soup is ok, but probably not worth the wait or discomfort if you don't have a tourist friendThe service staff tries to accommodate though, with extra orders so that aspect is fin
4
This is the place where I was first acquainted with the dish and I'd say it set the bar pretty high. No exaggeration but I can do with just the broth itself. yeah, it is THAT good. So glad to have dined here again after more than a year
1
We used to come here regularly but it seems to be getting more and more crowded each time we come. There always seem to be bus loads of tourists and everyone else has to stand around in the heat. This time, when we went for lunch, we waited at the door and a lady took our order, presumably to make sure you stayed in the queue and didn't leave. Still, even after pre-ordering, they still got our order wrong. Large serving of bak kut teh ended up small, instead of 3 bowls of rice we just ended up with 2. Our sodas never arrived either! It was quite hard to tell if the person taking the orders couldn't communicate or could not do her job properly. I'm looking elsewhere to have my bak kut teh
4
I noticed of late, tour groups in particular young tourists patronise this restaurant. There are most of the time long lines outside the two shops. But do not be put off. The staff manage the crowd well and have you seated in either shop depending on availability. I personally find the soup too peppery but like the mild herbal taste. The service is quick and staff attentive. The ribs are cooked to the right doneness.
2
Ambience – Overcrowded Food – Inconsistent Service – Average Overall – Overrated Feedback – Song Fa is not authentic because (1) some of us grew up eating loads of bak kut teh (2) ate at Song Fa many times and they are so-so. We hope that Song Fa will improve and wrote our feedback a few times to the management (also inquire about hygiene, long queue, and staff work condition). We never hear back from them. For better experience, recommend to load your calories at (1) Outram Park Ya Hua Rou Gu Cha at Keppel Road or (2) Old Street Bak Kut Teh at Funan Digitalife Mall

My wife and I stumbled across this restaurant on our first night in Singapore. We were tired and hungry and just needed something to eat - and quickly. The staff were friendly with OK english skills. We chose the new dish on the menu; one serve of braised pork belly. To accompany that we ordered one serve of steamed greens and a bowl of steamed rice each. The meal was served with a side of chopped chili; which I took advantage of. To wash it down, we ordered a lemon iced tea each. Total cost = SG$14.50The food arrived quickly and we paid as it was served. It was well cooked and tasty. It would not win any awards in Paris for culinary aesthetics but that was not important to us. Because we enjoyed that experience, we decided that we would further test the menu on our second night.We were not disappointed.On that occasion, we had pork loin rib soup, steamed greens and rice. The surprise here was that they continually came past with kettles of broth and topped off our bowls. The broth was a delightful peppery soup, spicy yet not over-powering. Total cost – SG$22-90.Overall – good quality, great service and great price
3
Located near the Park Hotel, an inexpensive dinner of about S$12. The broth was a bit spicy, very flavorful and the aroma of pork. I only had the small portions of sliced fish soup, chinese broccoli and biegnets. Funny thing was the wet towel and tea were charged for.
4
First time when We were in Singapore, we already love songfa very much. Rib meat is slide off easily from the bone and very tender.
Soup is bit peppery, but its ok overall. If possible, songfa might reduce the pepper.
Really recommended BKT in SG.👌
3
Was Good..Malaysian bak kut teh and Singapore bak kut teh are different so don't make any complaint on the pepper taste ;-)
2
Went with my boyfriend during my trip to Singapore. I love bak kut teh, especially peppery flavored ones, but I have to admit, I was disappointed by this place.I went around 9:30PM, a little before their closing time but there still was a long line of people waiting to be seated.I was hungry so I decided to go to the place with the air-con since there was no line.We sat, we ordered, and the food came.The soup did have a peppery taste, but it was just pepper and that's it.I can tell the soup didn't have much effort put into it to make it more tasty.Even the veggie we ordered didn't taste good, and I have never regretted ordering veggie because you can't go wrong.Since Song Fa is a famous and popular place, maybe my like in taste is a minority, but I definitely would not revisit, and would not recommend this place.Outram Ya Hua Gou Ru was delicious
5
For those of you non-chinese descends, Bak Kut Teh is basically pork soup. Ingredients include garlic and pepper (and some other secret spices, I suppose). In Song Fa, there are several options to choose from, but the most popular ones are the premium loin ribs or pork ribs. For side dishes, there are several choices also, like dough fritter (we Indonesians call it "cakwe") that you can dunk in the soup, salty vegetable ("sayur asin"), and braised chicken feet. Those are what I remembered, but there are also other choices.For drinks, they served tea-bags, chinese tea, can drinks, or home made drinks. I tried the barley water, and it was quite good.There are two shops open in Clarke Quay, one in the corner, and one in the next several doors. The later one opens only at 11AM, but the restaurant is completed with air-con. The corner restaurant opens very early, without air-con. When you come at 10AM, you're already too late. You willl see a line of people waiting to be seated
3
Went around 5.30 to 6pm and need not line up. After eating, we saw a long queue. So go early! Saving bucks? Decline the wet tissues provided. It's chargeable. Ask the waiter to recommend what to order and they will know how much to order based on your number of pax. Pay upon all food served at the table. Soup are refillable free of charge.This restaurant is more of pepper taste and less herbal essence. I personally prefer herbal essence more (more towards Malaysian style), which gave it a 3star instead of 4. However, worth a try there. Talk a walk down Clark quay after eating to enjoy the sunset
3
The local restaurent is just on the main road, 10 mins walking from MRT station NE5. It was crowded with lots of students around 6pm (close to some primary school). Price is reasonable with good quality for Singaporean foods - ~$30 for 3 dishes (2 meats & 1 vagetable)
4
I've tasted before a Bah Kut tea during my visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at first i would expect the same thing as what is on my mind about Bah Kut tea it is. But Song Fa, is a very different Bah kut Tea style, it really blow out my thought about the same Bah Kut Tea, the soup is clear and have a white pepper taste, the herbal is less strong than previous BKT i've ever taste. If you're a food-lover tourist then you should try this BKT, the price is not expensive, yet what you get is more than the price.to get to this place is also easy, very near to THE CENTRE Clark Quay. I would come to eat here again if i visit Singapore. must try
3
During my short layover in Singapore, this was just 2 minutes walk away from my hostel. The pork rib soup has a white pepper base. Meat is tender. It went well with a little bit of the sweet sauce that is black. It is above average. However, avoid dinner time as the queue starts to build up. As I was there alone, I was given priority to a seat, but I had to share the table space with a stranger
4
Recommended to visit this restaurant by a friend. Took a taxi to the restaurant though it is actually located at the corner across the road from Clark Quay MRT station. There was already a queue of a few people when we arrived. The restaurant has a Chinese style fitting with black wood table and square stool. The store wanted the queue to move as quick as possible so we are required to look at the menu and order while queuing. We ordered a regular Bak Kut The, one premium Bak KIut Teh, a pig tail, one chicken feet and bean curd, vegetable and rice. We were seated outside of the restaurant with some fans working around us. Though it was hot but still bearable even during lunch time. The dishes came after about 10 minutes after we were seated. The premium spare ribs were slightly better tasted than the regular ones but not obvious. The Bak Kut Teh did not have strong herbal taste but was put too much pepper, however, the refill of soup was free. It depends on whether you like a stronger taste or lighter taste of the soup, I think Soong Fa Bak Kut Teh was more on the light taste side but with strong pepper. So if you prefer stronger herbal taste and did not like pepper, this is probably not what you would like. The pig tail was, however, good taste and soft enough. It is not a dish you can find easily. The vegetable was chopped into small pieces which I prefer to eat in a bigger chunk.Overall taste of the food was good, service ok and price reasonable
4
Bak Kut Teh is one of the Chinese famous pork ribs soup. The ribs was are tender and the peppery taste soup was delicious. The soup have to drink when its really hot. There are also other good stuff like braised pork trotter and pork intestine (try it and you will loved it). Authentic yet fabulous
1
not so special.. common galbi soup flavour in Koreaa.
Too expensive.
Soup contains lots of pepper and MSG.
I do not recommend to taste it.
4
the pork meat: juicy, must queue before order because it gets crowded for dinner, overall, it tastes yumm!
4
one of the most delicious bak kut teh i've tasted. the price is higher than many other shops in singapore, but the serving is not so generous, rather smaller than the other famous shops. the services are good.
3
Service is good but the bak kut teh is too smooth for my liking and the soup too peppery. The side dishes are not bad tho
3
Nothing special about at this food shop, food average and normal to me , taste of the soup not bad. Price abit expensive due to the food are average. Outdoor seat are hot hope they can bulit in air con . Outside not fresh air at all because alot of car pass by at the main road
4
Well, the bak kut teh soup itself was somewhat a letdown. It didn't taste like bak kut teh I used to which is stronger in herbs. But otherwise, everything else was great. The ribs were juicy and fish was good. Service was fast. Good price for a proper meal in Singapore and I went more than once
4
Bak Kut Teh is a traditional Singaporean (and Malaysian) Chinese food normally served in Hawker Centre or traditional food centre without air-condition. Thus, until around 10 years ago, you must be prepared to sweat it out if you want to try this traditional food. However, restaurant such as Song Fa and Wong Ah Sio have open up another dimension to serve this traditional food in air-conditioning comfort. Eating in Song Fa (either at their downtown outlet or Changi Business Park outlet) you can enjoy this traditional pork rib soup, pigâ€™s trotter, intestine, kidney and liver soup with Chinese tea in air-con comfort
2
Since this is Song Fa Bak Kut Teh, that means they specialize in bak kut teh. They have many choices in their menu, but when I received my food, I was completely let down. The bak kut teh dishes didn't taste anything like it. Meaning, I didn't taste the herbs of bak kut teh at all, unless you consider a throat-scorching dose of pepper in the soup "bak kut teh". These guys put pepper in the soup like pepper is free, and what makes it even more annoying is that there is no consistency in the taste of the soup. I had 3 different types of bak kut teh, and all 3 soups had different tastes. But the bottom-line is, none of these 3 bowls of bak kut teh tasted like it. I don't think they really put any of the herbs in the soup at all. It's a ripoff.Absolutely not worth the prices they charge, for "bak kut teh" which isn't bak kut teh at all
4
worth a visit - definitely can go back againService - swift food - quiet good - love the fact that they are generous in refilling soupambience - noisy n small space - but acceptablevalue for money - will go back if I am in the are
5
There are many different eateries serving Bak Kut Teh and there is the Hokkien (dark soup) and Teochew (clear soup) versions too. Song Fa Bak Kut Teh started serving Teochew style bak kut teh in 1969 and my family has been patronizing ever since. Their peppery, aromatic soup and bak kut (pork rib) always taste authentic each time we visit and never fail to bring back that traditional taste that many newer establishment fail to replicate. Diners should also try their braised pork knuckle and side dishes at affordable prices. Locals and tourist can also be seen buying their boxes of Bak Kut Teh Spices @ $22 for a box of 10 packets to cook at home. Their service crew are efficient, courteous and keeps the place really clean. I take this opportunity to thank them for their good attitude and passion in the business. Thank you
1
one simple comment: this is not one of the better BKT i have tasted. It rates rather average. I just don't know why the hype. People talk about it like its the best BKT. Best, it's not. Good, it's also not. Average, it is...
5
Eating the bak kut teh with the pork intestines is very delicious, just can't get enough of it. will come back for more soon.
4
The meat was succulent and the broth was tasty. Goes really well with rice. I recommend that you try this with the fried dough fritters.
3
although i love pepperish bak kut teh, but this version of bak kut teh is overly pepperish. it is really hard to drink a 2nd or 3rd bowl, as it spices up one's throat. this is too overwhelming for my liking. but still, the meat is good too. the sides such as the preserved vegtables and peanuts need more work on them. they dont taste appetizing
5
The Bak Kut Teh is very nice, this is a white pepper type of bakut teh.The price is really reasonable, I always spend not more than $25 for two, but we have a very good meal. The service is excellent, food comes very fast, everything is running on the track.Payment only cash and NETS (singapore local payment method).I have tried several Bak kut teh in SG and theirs is one of the best at such a good price.Selling from original bakut teh (with the ribs bone still in tact), then they have braised trotter, pig's stomach, etc...Very recomended for you to have a quick lunch or dinner.Tips: try to come early lunch or early dinner, as the dinning time is always crowded
5
Even it's hot and humid but still hot soup is not bad at all! We order many foods and everything here is so fast. The way they ask order, serve food and walk around...it makes me feel like I have to eat fast too..this is too much a bit
4
Didn't know what all of the dishes were but it was very good. Very efficient staff and got you in and our. Had to wait a few minutes, but they took our order on the street and seated us shortly thereafter. Very good and reasonably priced. Would go again
5
We had an awesome lunch here with a cheap price! I wasn't expecting the crowd when we get there. There are a lot of tourists eating here and even taking a picture of the famous Bak Kut Teh! Good thing, the queue was not that long. Waiting time was less than 10 minutes as it was lunch time. They have also a very tasty salted veggie that you should try when you get here. If you like the soup, they also refill it for free. Staff were all efficient and helpful. They have a pay as you order system. Serving time was less than 10 minutes. Definitely, will come back here again.. very soon

- was crowded but the staff managed it well; they even have a queue system- staff was pretty spot on and will attend to you promptly- food was good; I especially like the prime ribs (tender and one bite will take the whole chunk off the bone).- the broth was done like how bah kut the should be done: awesome
5
I had been to some other Bak Kut Teh Restaurants that served good food, but this restuarant served delicious food with good service. The price of the 'Braised pig intestines' with the ' Kidney-in-soup' was cooked just right, neither too hard nor too uncooked. When it is dipped in the thick black sauce with chilli & eaten with piping hot white rice, it was simply declicious. Then again we had ' Sliced-fish soup' . The broth was clear & delicious. The 'Salted Vegetables' went well with our meal, as it did not taste salty but with the garlicky taste.It was really value for money & my family really enjoyed our meal

Delicious, good value and very traditional singapore bak kut teh.
If you have time to visit it is definitely recommended. This place gets very busy so avoid the peak hours of breakfast and lunch.
5
It is very crowded in the afternoon that we have to wait 15minutes before we got the table. So far the soup is tasty and better than Bakuteh at Rangoon Road. Price is also reasonable compared to other Bak Ku Teh stall...

We came across Song Fa Bak Kut Teh completely by chance walking around in Singapore! The soups are truly delicious and the pork succulent. I enjoy a little extra pepper on my soup so this one just fitted my taste perfectly. Although there was a queue, the service was pretty fast and efficient. Dinner there was a discovery for us in Singapore. We wish we had more time, we would definitely visit again

I'm a huge soup fan! HUGE. Bak Kut Teh is one of my favourite soups around. Song Fa served a good soup with succulent meat. The menu offered a good variety of pig offal, stewed pork and yummy side dishes to go with the soup. We really enjoyed their unlimited top up of soup when we were there. All we had to do was to inform the waitress you want a top up, and she would come along with a little hot kettle of soup. All done with a nice smile. We sat outside the shop so we got to enjoy nice cool breeze. Will definitely be back. Ohhh try to go outside Lunch and Dinner times. It was very crowded

Writing a review here for Song Fa's Branch at UE BizHub East, Changi Business Park, as there isn't a separate listing for them. Just discovered this restaurant 2 weeks ago, and we're already regular customers. Not a fan of herbal soups, I especially like Song Fa's Bak Kut Teh for their clear and slightly peppery broth. Service is efficient, although they do not charge a 10% service fee like most eateries. Queues move quickly, food is usually served in about 5 minutes after orders are placed, portions are generous and the waiter/waitress is always ready with a pot of hot soup for complimentary top-ups. Most customers go for their succulent pork ribs, but i personally enjoy their sliced fish soup, which uses the same yummy broth... so if there are friends/colleagues in your party who do not like pork ribs, you could recommend sliced fish.My meals always include a can drink (S$1.70), the smaller portion of the soup (S$6.50), a bowl of steamed rice (S$0.70) and a bowl of yutiao (S$1.00) (fried but non-oily dough fritters) to soak up the goodness of the broth, and this will cost S$9.90 including 7% govt. tax. Other dishes on the menu include Braised Pig's Trotter with Intestines, Braised Chicken Feet, Braised Beancurd Skin, Braised Groundnuts and a selection of Vegetables.Oh yes, here's a tip if you are looking to dabao (order takeaway) from this restaurant. You may call 66948098 to place your order and you or your friend/colleague can collect and make payment when it is ready. Truly convenient if you work in Changi Business Park

Just thinking about song fa bak kut teh is bringing saliva in my mouth. The soup is very delicious and the pork is soooo yummy. The place is very near with clark quay mrt station. Dont come there with very empty stomach because the place usually full and we must wait in line to get there
5
Simple and delicious. This place is a must if you want some delicious Singaporean food. It really is just pork broth and pork ribs, but bak kut teh quickly became one of my favorite meals in Singapore. I had one across the street from my apartment and across the street from my work, which was amazing. I never had to venture far to get my favorite fix. The service is quick and efficient. If you're not accustomed to it, you may think they are a little curt at times, but then you realize you'd be waiting an hour in line if the servers took the time for formalities. Grab a seat and enjoy your soup. The broth is filled with porky goodness and has some nice pepper. You will enjoy taking a nice bite of rib off the bone, or dip it in a little soysauce with chili pepper

Songfa is someone I keep coming back to for BTH. The pork ribs soup is so comforting and brings so much warmth on cold days. I used to go for the pork loin soup + rice but it became too difficult to eat without using my hands. I'm more always going for the pork slices + mee sua (thin noodles). The mee sua is an additional 2 bucks which I thought is quite ex but is is easier to go digest. The meat slice portions are adequate and the meat is tender and fresh. The salted vegetables taste a tad too sweet to be called preserved but it goes well with the food. The soup is very addictive though it's filled with pepper and after 2 bowls, you are literally all spiced up and looking for water. Addition of soup is free so feel free to ask around to get the staff to top it up. Queues form easily nearing dining hours so be sure to come early
5
I never like Ba Kut Teh before even my mother made it for dinner. Today, i went to Song Fa with my sister and relatives. I said to her that i will eat only veggies and still doubt the taste is worse like any other Ba kut Teh. I was wrong!!!!!! The soup is so tasty and i ask for more more more and more... The meat!??? Hmmm delicious!!!! And easy to chew. I will come again and take my mother so she knows the rite taste of Ba Kut Teh, what kind of son am i hahahahaha.... Check the picture for details!!

It's been 3-4 years since i've been back, and took the opportunity to bring some colleagues here. Went to the newer air-conditioned shop next to the original open-air space. At 1pm, there was a short queue but the wait was less than 10 minutesOrdered the standard broth with 3 pieces of pork rib, salted vegetables, and some fritters to go with the soup. The portions are tiny, the bowl was so small and there was very little soup. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if service was brisk and they keep topping up the soup, but they don't. They should be roving to every table and ensure everyone has enough soup. At the very least they should come to you quickly if you ask for more soup. These didn't happen. So it wasn't a very enjoyable experience as you feel shortchangedFor less crowds and better service, try the havelock road on
4
Food is really good as we are looking forward to come to this place. Resturant environment is match with the food - traditional friendly nice.
4
Very delicious bak kut teh with strong black pepper favour. The pork ribs are tender and you can unlimited refill the soup.
5
Great taste food, very reasonable price !!! Hygine service and missing visit this restaurant always. Walk distance to river side Clarke Quay. And,,,,,,,,, near "cruise" bath house. Songfa must visit when you leisure in this country !!!
5
Is one of my favorites places. Good price. Good location. Fast service. And you can get a vegan option. My fiancee is vegan and she is so happy about the MUI CHOi. (salted vegetables). So I eat pork and she eats this.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh actually has two restaurants in the same building (probably to cope with the lines of people trying to get in). They have one facing the main road and the other at the corner of the building, both on the ground floor of Rocha House, opposite Clarke Quay Central along New Bridge Road.I went there for lunch a few days ago. I went early but there were still lines of people waiting to get in. I was lucky to get a table after a short wait.The Bak Kut Teh was very nice. As in most places that serve Bak Kut Teh, they have 3 pieces of pork rib in the soup. Get a bowl of rice, the ribs and soup and a few freshly chopped chillies and settle down to eat. They then come around table to table with a kettle full of hot soup to top up your bowls, much like a tea stall with unlimited tea (after all Bak Kut Teh, literally translates to meat, or pork bone tea).The restaurant specialises in Bak Kut Teh but also serves a few other dishes. They have the same soup base with either pork ribs, pig's liver, or a few other options. They also have a few side dishes
4
With a great atmosphere, Song Fa Bak Kut Teh, is always in high demand. There is generally a queue of people waiting to be seated which is always a good sign in Singapore. The food is simple and delicious, they are also very generous topping up the peppery soup all of the meat is served in when required. The service is quick and attentive, we loved it
5
I spotted this place and wanted to go in and have a bite due to the amount of locals in the restaurant. I was very surprised by the food it was very good, and the price is very reasonable. any time I'm in Singapore Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is a must place to go
4
Go where the locals go. This is our lunch go to for Bak Kut Teh. Go early to beat the queue, and stuff your belly with this flavorful dish. The pork falls right off the bone Osso Bucco style, and the broth was flavorful and overflowing...only downside - I was hungry two hours later. Great bang for your buck in a city-state that has so many excellent dining options
5
My husband and I wanted some local fare and came across this place. We wish we had found it sooner,... we could have eaten more meals there...!! We just couldn't get enough of their broth.... Living in Australia currently, limits quality Asian food where we live and we could do with a place like this close to us to enjoy. You won't have any regrets dining at this place. I am not a fan of pork but they had fish slices and I was really enjoying the same broth as my husband as he had ordered pork... Pork or not, I had a couple of servings of their delicious, delicious broth.... Yum
3
Chanced upon this Bak Kut Teh place as its close to my office and so gave it a try as was a meeting a friend visiting from Bangkok and took her there but was really disappointed in the quality of the food, we ordered a Kidney soup and a Fish soup and the soup was cold and the kidney was over cooked and had a rubbery texture, you often think that when there is a queue of people for the restaurant it should be good but i can say this place if just mediocre , nothing to shout about really
4
If you like peppery version, here is definitely one of the better one around. Price is ok. It gets real crowded during peak hours. Got to queue for a table. Once you got one, the food is served faster than McDonald.
5
Just spent 5 days in Singapore and ate here every day. My wife and I loved it! Will definitely be back in the future.
5
I had dinner in Song Fa Bakut Teh Clarke Quay.
I tried their famous menu, pork soup.. Meat melting in my mouth.
Big portion. I also like the water chestnut.
I will definitely come back again..:D
5
Surprised by the 2 kedai separated closely cos its always packed by hungry customers. Been there with cousin who recommended us to try the premium rib. The meat was succulent, the broth was delicious, reminding me of my dad's bak kut teh. Nice nice. Companied by cai sim, some peanuts and cah kwe, and of course some chillies, and unique vintage interior that really brought that traditional but warm ambience, all rounded up our night with a full tummy and big smile. Will definitely go back and recommend it to the world. Thank u dear cousin to bring us here.

I went to Singapore for overnight trip and had the chance to eat at song fa bakuteh the first time with my parents.My parents love the food very much.It was nearing lunch time and the place was packed and we have to wait in line. But to my dissapointment, the food was not as great as I would love to be.The meat was a little tough, the side dishes was not as many options as those offered by competing restaurant. Yet, I have to admit, the portion is quite huge.The price is average so there isnt any real valued deal.Personally, I love the other bakuteh restaurant in tanjong pagar (unethical to say the restaurant name in this forum). But, it is a matter of personal taste
4
When we arrived we could see that the place is very popular as it was pretty crowded. A hotel staff suggested us this restaurant and when we had the food we could see why. Even though it was jam packed, the service never slowed and neither did we have to make do with cold food. The food always arrived piping hot on the table. We had the Song Fa soup, their specialty and I agree after tasting it that it was something that we could never get back at home. Visit it for its unique dishes and taste
4
I must state that I'm the kind who eats to live, not live to eat. So, I can't rave about the food because I don't know how. I have no internal yardstick to measure what is good, awesome or divine. If I like it, I just like it. And I like Song Fa Bak Kut Teh. I'm not a huge fan of the peppery soup but this one doesn't turn me off. In fact, the free flow of soup top-up seems to make the soup taste even better. I love that the meat are meaty. The side dishes taste like home-cooked food, which to me, is a plus point. What I loved about the place was the efficiency of the service crew. We got there slightly before the dinner crowd and was promptly ushered to a table. Less than 5 minutes after we ordered, the drinks came. Another 2 mins or so later, the food came. This came as a pleasant surprise because the place was 90% occupied by the time we ordered. The request to top up our soup was promptly delivered. For a non-air-con eatery, service was better than some restaurants I have been to. My only gripe was that the cloth used to clean and clear the tables was obviously stale. I could smell the musty stale lingering on the tables
4
The food is awesome here and we discovered it during our stay in Singapore. We visited this place twice.. The Song Fa soup was delicious. Never knew soups could be so mind blowing. The staff is really quick and efficient but I wish they had known more English. I would have loved to thank them for their service which was unfortunately not possible due to the language barrier. We look forward to visiting this easy on the pocket, great food serving place.Tip: Avoid peak hours as it gets really crowded
4
My friend, who is local, took me to Song Fa. I had many bak kut tae in my life but by far this is the best. It was so good that I have to come back again. The restaurant is in Clarke Quey area, opposite the big shopping mall called the Central. It's usually very crowded around 7.30-8.30pm. My recommendation is of course the famous spare ribs soup and pork kidney soup. Budget for two is around $20-30.The best part is the soup is free refill. You can ask for more soup free of charge;)
4
in my last trip to singapore , a friend took us to this restaurant . stories and delusion that are well known for this food triggers me to immediately taste it. there are lots of menu options , most preferably pork ribs at $ 6 for a small portion and $ 8 for a large portion . accompanied by a bowl of rice and sambal . unbelievably amazing.I chose barley water as a thirst-quenching . unique taste and healthy .a little difficulty is that you have to stand in line long enough to get a seat , especially if it coincides with mealtime . but everything was worth the taste.I would definitely go back again next tim
5
Clean, healthy flavors. Free top up of stock. Very cheap too but surprisingly filling with rice. We tried 2 toppings: the pork rib and pork bone.
5
Yummy, good price, good service size.
Absolutely great place for family eating.
The best bak kut teh in Singapore, in my opinion.
5
We try many bak kut teh around singapore, and without any doubts, we chose song fa as the winner. The broth were perfect, not too spicy but thick enough.The meat fell of the ribs instantly, melting in your mouth. The portion is big enough.Would I visit again? Absolutely
4
Sat down and was a little nervous as I eyes the menu and wasn't sure what to try (not the biggest fan of pork) but what arrived was delicious, comforting and more-ish. The chicken feet were actually really yummy and the pile of stewed bean curd skins and sauce it came with was complex and delicious. The bak kut teh was also delicious and the pork ribs soft and succulent. Definitely worth a stop...
5
Okay, I must admit this one's overcrowded with tourists and the staff barely speak english as their main language while serving foods to guests, but the foods are delicious and I don't know why I kept on repeating visit Song Fa everytime I come to Singapore

"Bak Kut Teh" (Rib Soup) is an interesting dish originally from Fu-Jian area in China. It may looks simple, pork ribs cooked with tons of garlic and spices, the composition of the spices and the amount does make a difference. I have tried Bak Kut Teh in several places in China Town and in other places when I visited Singapore, I found the one offered by Song Fa near Clarke Quay is the best. There are two Song Fa restaurants within the same block. One is located at the street corner and one is a few meters away with "better seating". I had my BKT at the street corner (I felt it more "authentic" eating that way) and I don't know the difference between these two restaurants. Typical BKT dinner include a bow of BKT soup with either steam rice or thin noddles. I added a plate of boiled vegetable and that's more than enough for me. They offer two kinds of BKT soups with different kind of ribs. I had tried both and found not much difference since the soup base was the same, so go for the cheap one. I also added a plate of the pork leg as another side dish when I had dinner with my German friend one night. He loved both the soup and the food.If you need more broth/soup, you can ask the waiter/waitress to refill the soup without extra charge. Notice that the restaurant may close on Mondays.If you like BKT, you can get a box of 10 (or 12) packs of the soup-base (secret formula) with you. I have tried to make it at home and the kids love it. The instruction is clear and simple. Just get some nice ribs, boil 2 litters of water and add garlic (2 or three cloves not a problem), the soup-base (both two pouches in the single package), some soy source and cook it for a couple hours. You can then have the same BKT as you have in Singapore
3
I tried Ng Ah Sio and Founder before, Song Fa soup definitely less peppery than the other two. But I noticed they choose to put more garlic in the soup for aroma. Still among the one you should try if you visit Singapore, but for me, next time I will have my bak kut teh elsewhere
4
First thing we did after checking in to our Hotel, we went out to eat chicken rice. Knowing the popularity of delicious chicken rice, we came here to eat... My daughter who is having a mouth sore find it uncomfortable to eat but since chicken rice is one of her fave.. patiently & slowly she managed to finished the whole set. We even got back there following day only to eat chicken rice.
4
You can tell how good this place is by the long queue, almost evey evening, from 7pm to very late at night. The soup is yummy (and you can request refills). In addition to different types of pork ribs, they also have chicken feet, intestines, pig trotters, etc, making this a great place for family outings. Service is swift. A large group can have a fulfilling meal for under $10
4
I could say they have the best bakut teh in town !!! their pork ribs very tender and also the pork tenderloin .. beside that they also have vegetable and chicken feet which I think it's a great combination for bakut teh !! the soup of bakut teh very delicious it's papery and very tasty !!!I want it again and again !!
4
I went down for lunch on a rainy sunday and the food was great and so cheap too. It was crowded but i got a table right away. If i was staying in singapore i would eat there again.
4
near the street and good taste of food, fast and delicious. should go there again someday. during lunch time it was full. they have delicious steam ribs
5
Good soup. Very tender pork ribs, inner parts and you Tiao.
Soup is not so peppery. Very delicious. Must try.
5
Will have at least 2-3 refills of the BKT soup whenever I dine at Song Fa. The service is pretty good and though crowded, staffs are always on the look for tables to be cleaned and cleared, and you will be seated in no time. most of the time, the meat served is tender and chewy, and love their wide variety of dishes and drinks on the menu
3
My taste for Bak Kut Teh can be a little more demanding probably because my late father used to cook home made ones and it's one of the best. This one for me is so so and I don't understand why it's so popular. Same story for the one voted tops at Havelock Road. Maybe it's the reasonable price. The soup isn't rich enough
4
Located across the Central Mall, this restaurant is so full during lunch / dinner time. gladly we visited before dinner time (around 6PM) and we still get a table.We ordered Pork Ribs Soup, Braised Pig Trotters, Kai Lan vegetables with additional dough fritters.We really enjoy all foods that we ordered. Taste very great (especially for the Pork Ribs Soup, try to press the whole garlic to make the soup more aromatic and flavored
4
On our first full day in Singapore we decided to stop here for breakfast rather than the normal hotel eggs, etc. The friendly staff recommended the pork ribs in soup with rice. Very nice and great value. Two of us ate for $S12. Check it out
4
For those who don't know bak kut teh pork ribs soup is tender pork ribs without horrible western BBQ sauce and in an endless pepper soup. Once the ribs are eaten the soup is topped up and is a must try, really excellent together with vegetables dough fitters and rice plus tea for 3 inc one pork rib soup each total bill 36 dollars. We went lunchtime in heavy rain and it was just perfect. The tea is the least enjoyable part as its simply one tea bag in a glass jug each. We prefer Chinese tea served in a tea pot. This is a must do lunch for anyone near Central mall we also liked the concept of paying as the food arrives which means no waiting around unless you wish to do so after eating. Just grea

Bak Kut Teh is a must try dish in Singapore! I love the aromatic pork rib soup, and you can eat it breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I lived about 10min walking distance to Song Fa and wanted to try it out since I always see it so crowded. I went at 8:30am before I leave for the airport and found the place to be packed already! However, a female staff quickly got me seated with menu in my hand. I ordered the original bak kut teh, braised small intestine, fried dough, and the housemade water chestnut drink. The meat was tender and the soup flavorful with a kick of white pepper. The drink was refreshing. Loved all of the foods that I have ordered! Also, the staff will come around the tables to refill the soup for you, so don't need to worry about running out - a great deal! Before I left, I bought a box of their bak kut teh packages so I can cook it at home as well
4
We tried Bak Kut Teh, Pork intestine and Chinese cabbage, the pork ribs was so tender and the soup was very authentic, very good taste and reasonably priced but be ready to queue as the restaurants always full during the dinner time up until closing time which is 9:30pm
4
The soup is so spicy and the herb was so tasty, i think the taste was similar with Ng Ah Sio at Ranggoon road ,but this place more easily to find..must try BKT !!
4
A lil bit salty of the food. But it's tasty for the first time.
5
The soup was amazing and the meat was so tender... I would eat here every night if there wasn't a wait!!! I am missing it very much!
4
I like boiled Spare Ribs. It tastes great and the large size cost SGD 8 and the small size cost SGD 6. Rice cost SGD 0.60
4
Apart from chicken rice, bak kut teh is the other Chinese dish you don't want to miss in Singapore. There are several famous bak kut teh places, I chose SongFa because of its location at Clarke Quay.
4
try the one nearby Clark Quay. Cheap, energizing, and seriously good bakut tea.
4
The dishes are a bit small in portions but it's pretty good. They're sauces are what makes it more tasty.
I'd go back there when I visit Singapore again.
3
i prefer the one in rochor centre kopitiam
5
I've tried many BKTs but this is the best. The soup is so delicious and the meat is so tender. The rice is also good. You don't need to ask for more bowl of rice. 1 bowl is big enough. On this trip, I went there twice and still craving for more. I will come back there every single trip to Singapore, absolutely!! They have 2 restaurants in New Bridge Rd. So you can choose which place you like to eat. It's so easy to find. Just go to Central Clarke Quay then across the street. I will definitely come back again and again and again. Best BKT!

This is the famous Bah Kut Teh known by all Singaporean. Unlikely Malaysian Bah Kut Teh, the soup is white in colour and the taste is totally different. It is very difficult to comment about the taste as I cannot compare it to Malaysian bah Kit Teh due to different taste. But for me, I think the soup is superb and the spare rib is very juicy and tender. The resturant open the whole day till night but I would recommend to go in the late evening because of two reasons: first, the restaurant is not air-conditioned and very hot in the afternoon, second, the restaurant is very near to Clarke Quay. So, after the meal, you can have a stroll to Clarke Quay where is more vibrant at night. The atmosphere is slight noisy. The staffs are unfriendly and you have to ask several times for extra soup. To me, it is a typical Chinese Resturant which only deserves 3 stars
