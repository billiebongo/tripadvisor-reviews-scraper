This is by far the best BBQ restaurant I've been to in Singapore. The food are authentic and delicious. Just delicious. The restaurant is always full of customers, which demonstrates its popularity.

Not cheap, interesting food but not sure I'll ever go back. Pig skin, mutton are the more unusual items, skewered and spiced differently from other local satays.

Good place to catch up with friends over beer and BBQ. I liked the grilled mushrooms - enoki, oyster mushrooms, king mushrooms, shitake...chicken wings and pork belly, grilled pineapples are tasty too. But we are not too keen on the seafood platter which came in a foil plate with some gravy. If you don't drink normally, you can still try the refreshing tsingtao beer, it's very light and goes well with BBQ

We stopped for a light lunch and an assortment of meats and wings. Every table has a metal-box. The meats are delivered on skewers and placed on the boxes. Fun! We had a cold beer and dug in. Be warned that the spicy wings really are spicy

The sign on the door says open to 2am so a group of 15 of us went down for a supper at 12.15am, but staff said no more service. When we asked why the sign says 2am they said that was their go home time and they where too tired to service Any more food.

At the behest of a friend and family I visited this eatery. It's fair to say that the BBQ was done tastefully and it was enjoyable overall. As someone not used to eating variety of body parts I found it to be rather okay to taste new things.
