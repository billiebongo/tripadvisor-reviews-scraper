This place was a welcome treat during a recent trip through Changi. A well run Starbucks at Terminal 1, open 24 hours. Great coffee, teas, pastries and sandwiches too.
Friendly attentive staff also.

It was a Latte on the Go with the all time favorite banana cake .. Have always loved this place .. Was a little crowded but that that is expected at an airport

Nothing different as compared to the other starbucks outlets you would have been to. This one has the same menu as the other outlets in the chain and the staff is also friendly.
Do try the cafe mocha.

Needed a coffee yesterday morning - checked in early then caught a taxi nearby to this outlet.Enjoyed a typical Starbucks cappuccino plus a banana walnut muffin - the outlet was quite busy with people waiting for friends or relatives.Just near the Forex and Tour desks - give it a go if you want a coffee

I happened to be in the airport not k owing what I wanted to drink or eat. I was on my way to the gate to make my next flight and found Starbucks on the way. I had the iced green tea which was mediocre and a couple of sandwiches. The first egg and lettuce sandwich had lettuce that resembled a damp rag and was limp and transparent from to ,ice exposure to high fridge temperatures. So they let me change it to another one. The second sandwich was ham and cheese with gerkin. This was absolutely disgusting. The bread could have been used as a surf board for pigeons flying by and the contents were substandard. The tomatoes were green and hard and the cheese had been on the bread way to long. I would have gone for a refund but I had to get to the gate as that was the main priority, otherwise I would have gone for a refund. Seriously need to improve the quality of food

Still expensive poor quality coffee, the staff were friendly and there were tables to sit at. But the coffee was bad, weak, tasted burnt.

Not the best. Coffee was not the hottest either.
Very simple shop area but difficult for luggage trolleys.

Good service from friendly staff providing excellent coffee when you need it most. As always standards you can spect from this worldwide chain.

This Starbucks provides you with the ability to obtain a quick coffee when you get off the plane with the minimum amount of fuss. A consistant product that is served quickly by friendly staff.

Always good food and drinks. Seating area a bit cramped and small for the location. Service was OK - nothing special, but I'd go back again!

Whenever I wanna go back to my city, I'll be waiting in Starbucks.. Have a chitchat and coffee with my loved ones is a perfect blend.. I love Singapore and everything on it..

What a little gen in the middle of a busy airport terminal. With all the usual enjoyable Starbucks coffee, its easy to relax and soak up the atmosphere around the airport

I bought a pretzel which was dry beyond belief - more like a stick of chalk. The yogurt and granola was very strange. Definitely one to avoid.

Customs side of terminal 1 is Starbucks Coffee.So if you have just landed you can go to Starbucks before going thru customs or if you are leaving Singapore it is after customs.I had a tall Cappuccino and it was $5.70.Great taste and great service

Early flight, 5am visit.Coffee fine as usual, the elderly tuna sandwich was honking. The lettuce had pretty much disintegrated into liquid, giving a distinctive yet unappealing watery-bread texture.Gave it back, told the assistant it was inedible. No offer of a refund, or replacement. She did offer another equally elderly sandwich. Which I declined..
