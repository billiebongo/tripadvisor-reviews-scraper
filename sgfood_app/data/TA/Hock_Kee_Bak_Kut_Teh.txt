I loved the Bak Kut Teh here, the soup is delicious and the meat was very tender.
The uncle and auntie running the shop are also extremely friendly.
Great soup at only 6S$, I can only recommend trying it!

Hearty meal with piping hot herbal soup with succulent lean premium pork ribs. We indulged in the black pork trotters too - tender and delicious but not the healthiest choice with soft melt-in-the-mouth belly fat!
Prices are very reasonable.

Review by DrSim001 (Dr HCM Sim). Good Bak Kut Teh. Hawker Centre. No Air-Conditioning. The Bak Kut Teh is Hokkien style, according to the lady boss. For $6, I got quite a bit of meat. Soup is not salty but has the herbal taste. I ate the Bak Kut Teh with $1 of salted vegetable. Overall a good meal. Regards DrSim001 (Dr HCM Sim)
