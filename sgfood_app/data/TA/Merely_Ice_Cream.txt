Small little ice cream parlor. Very interesting/different ice cream flavor choices. They are known for changes in their flavors. The waffle cone was very good. I got the Salted Caramel flavor in a waffle cone and was delish! Highly recommended. Tables inside and outside.

Came in during the afternoon to have some ice cream with my SO. The service staff were very helpful, giving us suggestions about flavors etc.
The portions were quite huge.

Great ice cream shop.
Interesting flavors, both for their specialties, or for more usual ones.
Open until late at night.
No wifi, and only takes cash.

Been here many times and I'm always satisfied with the service. Kelly the employee has the best scooping ability.Her hands are so talented and she scooped the biggest, most perfect looking ice cream Balls.Merely ice cream? I don't think so. Look for Kelly when you're here.

The place is kind of full during weekends at night. The ice creams r delicious not too sweet its just perfect. The waffles r soft just the way i like it. The staff is very polite and welcoming. Must go if u r there around that area

I chanced upon this place while waiting for some other work to be done. What a find!! The smell of the fresh waffle drew me in and I couldn't resist anymore. I tried a few of the flavours and settled on the salted butterscotch in fresh waffle cone... I am a total smitten for freshly made ice cream, you could taste the creaminess... and so reasonably priced! Really a hidden gem tucked away at Sunshine plaz

Used to be my favorite ice cream place but i won't come back after a horrible service. Told one of the staff that there was no seat around and she already prepared the waffle served with ice cream.She reacted by pointing towards the corner. The space was so squeezy considering i am not that skinny and my bf is tall,we can't fit in the space she pointed. So she ask one of the customers to move away and let us seat at the bigger space. While we were seated she threw the plate filled with ice cream and waffle towards us. I was shock by her reaction. If you have a bad day, don't take it on us. Afterwards i address the matter to the owner and another staff refunded me after i told her i refuse to eat the ice cream that was served. Good ice cream though but bad customer service!

This ice cream store is near my school and it is a favourite of my friends & I. The ice cream is reasonable ( $3++ for a scoop) and there are lots of interesting flavours to choose from. My favourite flavours are the smores ice cream as well as the milo ice cream as they are absolutely delicious and leave me wanting more. The store is a small and cozy place and is good for small meetups

When we been there, we tried to have Marely ice cream, was so delicious.. suitable with the hot weather of Singapur, Hope we will be there again and will have Ice cream.

Found this after dinner walking back to our hotel! Went back every day while in Singapore! The BEST ice cream.... Some unusual flavours to taste too. Highly recommend the salted butterscotch! Yumm!

This place serves a good variety of ice cream flavors. My favorite is the salted butterscotch, while my kids love the grape yakult yogurt! And the bowls and waffles they make go down great with their ice cream. A good selection of teas are available too

Stumbled across this place on the way home from dinner and very glad we did! The servings are generous, the prices are good and most of all, the ice cream tastes delicious. Totally unconventional flavours so it was hard to choose but the salted butterscotch was particularly amazing... Their best seller apparently

A must go! You will not be disappointed. I they have quite a number of flavors. I love their milo fudge cake ice cream It was too good. I especially loved their waffles! So soft and fluffy on the inside yet crispy on the outside. Waffle ice cream lovers, you'll be very please‚ò∫

This little joint is like a hangout place for the art students so it has a laid back atmosphere. The homemade ice creams are good, faves are coconut (if they get their hands on enough Thai coconuts), earl grey, salted butterscotch. Have it with their freshly made cones and waffles too. Great pit stop and respite from the hot weather

Everything about this place screams creative! From the ice-cream to the mural. A good place to chill out and enjoy ice-cream on a typical humid day in Singapore. Love the salted butterscotch with waffles ! A beautiful fusion of sweet and butter on your palate. Many local art collaterals are available for browsing (and taking), so you can eat your ice-cream, chill and pick up a magazine to check out the latest happenings in our local art/design scene. Love that the owners are down to earth and believe in selling pure, unadulterated ice cream. Top it off with the artsy vibe, is one that would keep me coming back for more

They serve really yummy ice cream til late at night around 11pmThey have pineapple tart ice cream as a special flavor right now and it tastes exactly like pineapple tarts down to the crumbly pastry! Fantastic!! Tried the grape yakult yogurt which has a light taste too! Green tea along with white chocolate speculoos were great as well! They have lychee beer sorbet which we ordered as well! Bought 2 pints of pineapple tart ice cream back to enjoy! Only complaint is that it melts too fast even for a short drive home. Heard that they have great waffles and cones but haven't gotten round to trying them

I love finding great ice cream or gelato places. So far, Merely Ice Cream is the best one since I have only been living in Singapore for 3 months. I rated it very good since I have high expectations for ice cream having lived in places that have phenomenal ice cream and gelato. Granted this is Singapore, it is very good! The Chocolate stout is decadent...it would be great to have an affogato with it! This is a must try place particularly their salted butterscotch

This little place on Bencoolen Street has about a dozen or so flavours of ice cream, some regular, some different.I tried the Zesty lemon (nice), Chocolate stout (Valrhona chocolate with light stout, very nice), Salted butterscotch (ok), Red Velvet cake ice cream (ok), Rum and Raisin (very nice), and Nutty beer ice cream (beer and pistachio, very nice)
